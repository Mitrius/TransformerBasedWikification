{American English} or {United States} {English language} {be} {the} {dialect} {of} {the} {English language} spoken {in} {the} {United States}
It {be} {different} {in} some ways from other types {of} English such {as} {British English}
Many types {of} {American English} came from {local government} {dialect} {in} England
Many {people} today know about {American English} {even} {if} they live {in} {a} {country} where another {sort} {of} {English language} {be} spoken
This {may} {be} because {people} hear {and} read {American English} through {the} {mass media} for {example} {movie}s {Television programme} {and} {the} {Internet} where {the} most {Common year} {form} {of} {English language} {be} {Americans} English
Because {people} all over {the} {world} use {the} {English language} it gets many {new} words
{English language} has {be} changing {in} this way for {hundred} {of} years

Sometimes {people} learn {American English} {as} it {be} spoken {in} America
For example {in} {telephone} call centers {in} {Ancient India} {and} other places {people} often learn {American English} {to} {sound} more {like} their customers who call from America
These {people} often keep using {American English} {in} everyday life
The {meaning} {of} many {word} {be} {different} {in} {Americans} English
Most changes {in} {a} {language} {start} with {small} things
For example {Italian language} {Spanish language} {and} {French language} all came from {Latin}
There {be} many {word} that {sound} {the} same {in} both {American English} {and} {Britain} English but {be} {spelling} differently
For example  
Words originally from {French language} that end {in} our {in} {British English} behaviour colour honour neighbour etc end {in} or {in} {American English} behavior color honor neighbor
{Word} that come from {French language} that end {in} re {in} {British English} metre centre end {in} er {in} {Americans} English
In these cases {Canadian English} usage {be} {to} keep {the} {Britain} and French spelling 
Verbs that end {in} ise {in} {British English} criticise realise end {in} ize {in} {American English} criticize organize realize
However {the} ize ending {be} optional {in} {Britain} English {and} {be} shown {as} {a} option {in} {Britain} dictionaries 
One {of} {the} changes introduced by {Noah Webster} {be} {the} change {of} {the} double l from {word} {like} travelled {to} traveled

About 51 {million} {Native Americans} live {in} {Latin America}
Sometimes these {people} {be} called Indians but this {be} confusing because it {be} {the} same {word} used for {people} from {India}
When {Christopher Columbus} {be} {travel} {West} {he} did {not} know about {the} {Americas}
He {thought} {he} {be} going {to} {West Indies} so {he} called {the} {people} Indians

{Ancient Egypt}{Flax}  {Farming} {be} {cell growth} {crop}s or keeping {animals} by {people} for {food} {and} {raw material}s
{Farming} {be} {a} part {of} {agriculture}
{Agriculture} {start} {thousand} {of} {year} ago but {no} {one} knows for sure how {old} it is
The {development} {of} {farming} gave rise {to} {the} {Neolithic Revolution} whereby {people} gave {up} {nomad}ic {hunting} {and} became {settler}s {in} what became {cities}
{Agriculture} {and} {domestication} probably {start} {in} {the} {Fertile Crescent} the {Nile} Valley The {Levant} {and} {Mesopotamia}
The {area} called {Fertile Crescent} {be} {now} {in} {the} {country} {of} {Iraq} {Syria} {Turkey} {Jordan} {Lebanon} {Israel} {and} {Egypt}
{Wheat} {and} {barley} {be} some {of} {the} first {crops} {people} grew
People probably {start} {agriculture} slowly by {plant} {a} few crops but {still} gathered many {food} from {the} wild
People {may} have {start} {farming} because {the} {weather} {and} {soil} began {to} change
{Farming} can feed many more {people} than {huntergatherer}s can feed on {the} same {amount} {of} land
{Agriculture} {be} {not} only {cell growth} {food} for {people} {and} animals but also {cell growth} other things {like} {flower}s {and} {nursery} {plant}s manure or dung {animal} hides {skin}s or {fur}s {leather} animals fungi {fiber}s {cotton} {wool} {hemp} {and} {flax} {biofuel}s  {and} {drug}s bio{pharmaceuticals} {marijuana} {opium}
Many {people} {still} live by {subsistence agriculture} on {a} {small} farm
They can only {cell growth} enough {food} {to} feed {the} farmer his family {and} his animals
The {yield} {be} {the} {amount} {of} {food} grown on {a} given {amount} {of} land {and} it {be} often low
This {be} because {subsistence} {farmers} {be} generally less {education} {and} they have less {money} {to} {buy} equipment
{Drought} {and} other {problem} sometimes cause {famine}s
Where {yield} {be} low {deforestation} can provide {new} {land} {to} {cell growth} more food
This provides more {nutrition} for {the} {farmer} family but can {be} bad for {the} {country} {and} {the} surrounding {environment} over many years
In rich countries {farm} {be} often fewer {and} larger
During {the} {20th century} they have become more productive because {farmers} {be} able {to} {cell growth} better {variety botany} {of} plants use more fertilizer use more water {and} more easily {control} weeds {and} pests
Many {farm} also use machines so fewer {people} can {farm} more land
There {be} fewer {farmers} {in} rich countries but {the} {farmers} {be} able {to} {cell growth} more
This {kind} {of} {intensive agriculture} comes with its {own} set {of} problems
{Farmer} use {a} lot {of} {chemical industry} fertilizers {pesticide}s chemicals that {kill} bugs {and} {herbicide}s chemicals that {kill} weeds
These {chemicals} can {pollute} {the} {soil} or {the} water
They can also {create} bugs {and} weeds that {be} more resistant {to} {the} chemicals causing outbreaks {of} these pests
The {soil} can {be} damaged by {erosion} blowing or {wash} away {sodium chloride} buildup or loss {of} structure
{Irrigation} adding {water} from rivers can {pollute} {water} {and} lower {the} {water} table
These {problem} have all got solutions {and} modern young {farmers} usually have {a} {goodness} technical education
{Fertilizer}s 
{Crop rotation} 
{Weed} removal 
{Breeding} 
{Agricultural fencing} 
{Ranching} 
{Plantation}  {Farmer} select {plants} with better yield taste {and} {nutrition}al value
They also choose {plants} that can {survive} {plant disease} {and} drought {and} {be} easier {to} harvest
Centuries {of} {artificial selection} {and} breeding have had enormous effects on {the} characteristics {of} {crop} plants
The {crops} {produce} better {yield} with other techniques use {of} fertilizers {chemical industry} pest control irrigation
Some {company} have {be} searching for {new} {plants} {in} {Poverty} countries {and} {genetics} modify these {plants} {to} improve them
They then try {to} {patent} {the} {seeds} {and} {sales} them {back} {to} {the} {Poverty} countries
New {plants} {be} {create} with {genetic engineering}
One {example} {of} {genetic engineering} {be} modifying {a} {plant} {to} resist {a} herbicide
It {be} important for there {to be} enough {food} for everyone
The {food} must also {be} {safe} {and} good
People say it {be} {not} always safe because it contains some chemicals
Other {people} say {intensive agriculture} {be} damaging {the} environment
For this reason there {be} several types {of} agriculture 
Traditional {agriculture} {be} mostly done {in} {Poverty} countries 
Intensive {agriculture} {be} mostly done {in} {country} with more money
It uses pesticides machinery {chemical industry} fertilizers
Organic {farming} {be} using only {natural} {product business} such {as} compost {and} {green} manure
Integrated {farming} {be} using {local government} resources {and} trying {to} use {the} {waste} from {one} {process} {as} {a} {resource} {in} another process
{Agricultural policy} focuses on {the} goals {and} methods {of} agricultural production
Common goals {of} {policy} include {the} quality amount {and} safety {of} food
There {be} some serious {problem} that {people} {face} trying {to} {cell growth} {food} today
These include 
{Erosion}

{Anatomy} {be} {the} {research} {of} {the} {bodies} {of} {people} {and} other animals
{Anatomy} {be} {the} {research} {of} {the} inside {of} {the} {body} {and} outside {the} body
{Anatomy} {note music} {the} {position} {and} {structure} {of} {Organ anatomy} such {as} {Muscle} {Gland} {and} {Bone}
A {person} who {Research} anatomy {be} {a} anatomist
The {history} {of} anatomy dates {back} {to} {1600} {BC} when {Ancient Egypt} began {research} {human} anatomy
They discovered {the} {Function mathematics} {of} many {Organ anatomy} {like} {the} {liver} {spleen} {Kidney} {heart} {Et cetera} {and} {be} {the} first {to} discover {the} {structure} {and} {Function mathematics} {of} {the} {lymphatic system}
For {long} {Period punctuation} {the} dissection {of} deceased {people} {be} forbidden {and} correct {idea} about {human} anatomy {be} {a} {long} {time} coming
{Academic} {human} anatomists {be} usually employed by {University} {Medical school} {and} {teaching} hospitals
They {be} often involved {in} teaching {and} research
Gross anatomy {Research} {computer hardware} {of} {the} {body} that {be} big enough {to} see
{Microanatomy} {Research} {small} parts
There {be} {different} {organ system}s such {as} {the} {cardiovascular system} also known {as} {the} {circulatory system} the {system} that gets {blood} around {the} body {the} muscular {system} the {system} that contains {muscle}s {the} {nervous system} the {system} that {control} {the} {nerve}sand {the} brain {and} {the} {skeleton} the bones

{NEAR} An {asteroid} {be} {a} {Outer space} {Stone}
It {be} {small} {Object grammar} {in} {the} {Solar System} that {travel} around {the} {Sun}
It {be} {like} {a} {planet} but smaller
They range from very {small} smaller than {a} {car} {to} 600 {miles} 1000 km across
A few {asteroid} have {asteroid moon}s
The {name} asteroid means like {a} star {in} {the} {Ancient history} {Greek language}
Asteroids {may} look {like} {small} {star} {in} {the} sky but they really do {Movement} around {the} {Sun} while {star} only seem {to} {Movement} because {the} {Earth} spins
Like planets {asteroid} do {not} make their {own} {light}
Because {of} this some {people} think asteroids {be} {not} {a} {goodness} name {and} think that {the} {name} planetoid like {a} planet would {be} {a} better name
Giuseppe Piazzi found {the} first asteroid {in} 1801
It {be} {name} {1 Ceres} {and} {be} {the} biggest {Object grammar} {in} {the} {asteroid belt}
Other {asteroid} {in} {the} {asteroid} belt {like} {3 Juno} {2 Pallas} {and} {4 Vesta} {be} found later
Today {astronomer} using computerized {telescope}s find {thousand} {of} {asteroid} every month
{Asteroid impact prediction} {be} {one} {of} {the} purposes
Asteroids {be} {the} leftover {rock geology} {and} other {material} from {the} {Age of the Earth} {of} {the} {Solar System}
These {Stone} {be} too {small} {to} come together {to} make {a} planet
Some {be} made {of} {carbon} or {metal}
Depending on whats on {the} surface they {be} classified into {Time in Australia} {asteroid spectral types} including Type {Community of Madrid} metal Type S stone {and} Type C carbon
Most {asteroid} {in} our {Solar System} {be} {in} {the} {asteroid belt} between {Mars planet} {and} {Jupiter planet}
Many {be} {not} {in} {the} main {asteroid} belt
The {one} that come close {to} {Earth} {be} called {NearEarth asteroid}s
Many {scientists} think {asteroid} striking {the} {Earth} {kill} off {KT extinction event} {and} caused some {of} {the} other {extinction event}s
{Colombia} {Greece} uses {column} all made {in} ston  Architecture {be} {the} {art} {and} {science} {of} {the} {design} {of} {structure}s or {building}s such {as} houses places {of} worship {and} {office} buildings
Architecture {be} also {the} {profession} {of} {a} {architect}
Usually {a} {person} must  at {a} {institution} {of} {higher education} university {to} become {a} {architect}
In {Ancient history} times there {be} {architect} {long} before there {be} higher education
Architecture can {be} about {small} designs such {as} {a} {garage} or large designs such {as} {a} whole {city}
Architecture often overlaps with {civil engineering} {and} {architect} {and} civil {engineer} often {Employment} together
In {the} past {people} built s {and} {wood} {house}s {to} protect themselves from {the} weather
For safety they {be} often close together
Great {civilization}s {like} {the} {Ancient Egypt}ians built large {temples} {and} structures {like} {the} {Great Pyramids of Giza}
The {Ancient Greek}s {and} {Ancient Rome}s made what we {now} call {Classical Architecture}
The Romans working over {2000} {year} ago {copy} {the} {arch} from {the} {Etruscans} who {copy} it from {the} {Mesopotamia}ns
The {stone} {column}s which {still} hold {up} so many important buildings {like} {the} {Parthenon} {in} {Athens} {be} simply {copy} from {the} first wooden posts
{Hungary} {Classical Architecture} {be} very formal {and} it always obeyed {laws}
It used {symmetry} which really means  {and} it used {proportion} which means keeping {shape} {in} certain ways
The {Golden ratio} {be} {a} {rule} or law which said to put it very simply {if} {you} {be} making {a} room or any other thing it {will} {Employment} best {if} {you} always make {the} {long} {side} 16 {time} longer than {the} {short} side
There {be} many {laws} {in} {Classical Greece} Architecture {like} how high {the} {middle} {of} {a} {arch} {bridge} {need} {to be} which depends on how {wide} {the} {bridge} {need} {to} be
These {laws} {be} learned from {thousand} {of} {year}s {of} {experience} {and} they {be} {as} {true} today {as} they {be} {2000} {year} ago
In some {computer hardware} {of} {the} world {like} {India} {the} {architecture} {be} famous for {carving} {the} {stone} on {temples} {and} palaces
Different architectural styles {be} made {in} {China} {Japan} Southeast Asia {Africa} {Mexico} {and} {Central America} {and} {South America}
Later {people} {in} {Western Europe} {in} {the} {Middle Ages} made {Romanesque architecture} then {Gothic architecture}
{Gothic} {building} have tall {point} {window}s {and} arches
Many {church}es have {Gothic} architecture
{Castle}s {be} also built at this time
In {Eastern Europe} {church} usually had {dome}s
People added their {own} {idea} {and} {decoration} {to} {the} {Classical Architecture} {of} {the} past
The {Renaissance} brought {a} return {to} classical ideas
{Guggenheim Museum} {in} {New York City} In {the} late {18th century} with {the} {Industrial Revolution} {people} began {to} {invent} {machine} {to} make things quickly {and} cheaply
Many {factory} {and} {Mill factory} {be} built during or {after} this revolution
Decades later {in} {the} {Victorian era} {architect} {like} {George Fowler Jones} {and} {Decimus Burton} {still} followed {the} {Gothic} style {to} build {new} churches
Up {to} this point {building} {be} {limit} {in} {size} {and} style by {the} strength {of} {the} {wood} {and} {masonry} used {to} construct them
{Gothic} {cathedral} {be} among {the} largest {building} because {the} gothic {arch} when combined with {buttress}es allowed {stone} {building} {to be} built taller
For example {the} {cathedral} {in} {Ulm} {Germany} {be} over 500 {Foot unit of length} tall
However {building} with {stone} has its limits {and} {building} too tall could result {in} collapse
This happened {to} {the} {Beauvais Cathedral} which {be} never completed
{Willis Tower} {in} {Chicago}  Towards {the} end {of} {the} {19th Century} with {a} {second} Industrial Revolution {steel} became much cheaper
{Architect} began {to} use {inventions} {like} {metal} girders {and} {reinforced concrete} {to} build
An {example} {be} {the} {Eiffel Tower} {in} {Paris}
Buildings can {now} {be} built taller than ever before
We call them {skyscrapers}
This {new} {technology} has made us {free} from traditional limitations {and} because {of} {the} {new} possibilities presented by these materials many traditional methods {of} {construction} {and} {idea} about style {be} reevaluated replaced or abandoned
Cheap strong {glass} soon brought {transparency} exterior walls especially for {office} buildings
{Modernism} {be} {the} {name} for {the} architectural style which developed because {of} these {new} {building} technologies {and} its beginnings can {be} {see} {as} early {as} 1890
{Modernism} can also refer {to} {a} specific {group} {of} {architect} {and} {building} from {the} early {to} late {June 20} century {and} so {may} {not} {be} {the} proper {term} {to} use for many {building} built since then which {be} sometimes called postmodern
Many {of} {the} {world} greatest {structure} {be} built by modernday {architect} such {as} {Frank Lloyd Wright} {I M Pei} {Adrian Smith architect} {Edward Durell Stone} {Frank Gehry} {Fazlur Khan} {Gottfried Bhm} {and} {Bruce Graham}

The {apple} {tree} {Malus} domestica {be} {a} {tree} that {cell growth} {fruit} such {as} apples {in} {the} {Rosaceae} best known for its juicy tasty fruit
It {be} grown worldwide {as} {a} {fruit} tree
It {be} considered {to be} {a} worldwide lowcost {fruit} harvestable all over {the} world
The {tree} originated {in} {Central Asia}
{Apple} have {be} grown for {thousand} {of} {year} {in} {Asia} {and} Europe
They {be} brought {to} {North America} by {European people} settlers
{Apple} have religious {and} mythological significance {in} many cultures
{Apple} {be} generally propagated by {grafting} although wild {apple} {cell growth} readily from {seed}
{Apple} {tree graph theory} {be} large {if} grown from seed but {small} {if} grafted onto {roots} rootstock
There {be} more than 7500 known {cultivars} {of} apples with {a} range {of} desired characteristics
Different {cultivars} {be} {domestication} for {Time in Australia} {taste} {and} uses cooking eating raw {and} {cider} production {be} {the} most {Common year} uses
{Tree} {and} {fruit} {be} {attack} by {fungi} {bacteria} {and} {pests}
In 2010 {the} {fruit} {genome} {be} {sequence analysis} {as} part {of} {research} on {disease} {control} {and} {selective breeding} {in} {apple} production
Worldwide production {of} {apple} {in} {2013} {be} 908 {million} tonnes
{China} {cell growth} 49 {of} {the} total
The {apple} has {a} small leafshedding {tree} that {cell growth} {up} {to}  tall
The {apple} {tree} has {a} broad {crown} with thick {twig}s
The {leaf} {be} {Phyllotaxis} {simple} {oval}s
They {be} 5 {to} 12 {centimeter} {long} {and} 36centimetres 1224in wide
It has {a} {sharp} top with {a} soft underside
{Blossom}s come {out} {in} {spring} at {the} same {time} that {the} {leaf} begin {to} bud
The {flower}s {be} white
They also have {a} slightly pink color
They {be} five {petal}ed {and} 25 {to} 35 {centimeter} 098 {to} 14 in {in} 
The {fruit}  {in} {autumn}
It {be} usually 5 {to} 9 {centimeter} 20 {to} 35 in {in} diameter
There {be} five {carpel}s arranged {in} {a} {star} {in} {the} {middle} {of} {the} fruit
Every {carpel} has {one} {to} three {seed}s
{Kazakhstan}   The wild {ancestor} {of} {apple} {tree graph theory} {be} {Malus sieversii}
They {cell growth} wild {in} {the} {mountain}s {of} {Central Asia} {in} {the} {north} {of} {Kazakhstan} {Kyrgyzstan} {Tajikistan} {and} {Xinjiang} {Peoples Republic of China} They {be} being used recently {to} develop {Malus} domestica {to} {cell growth} {in} {cold} 
{Apple} {be} brought {to} {North America} {in} {the} 1600s
{2017 Westminster attack} {apple} {orchard} on {the} {North Africa} {Americans} {continent} {be} said {to be} {near} {Boston} {in} 1625
In {the} 1900s costly {fruit} {industry} where {the} {apple} {be} {a} very important species began developing
Different {cultivars} {be} available for {temperate} {and} {subtropical} climates
One large collection {of} over 2100 {apple} {cultivars} {be} at {the} {National Museum of China} Fruit Collection {in} {England}
Most {of} these {cultivars} {be} grown for eating fresh dessert apples
However some {be} grown simply for {cooking} or making {cider}
Cider {apple} {be} usually too  {to} eat immediately
However they give {cider} {a} rich {flavor} that dessert {apple} cannot
Most popular {apple} {cultivars} {be} soft but 
Colorful skin easy shipping {disease} resistance {Red Delicious} {apple} shape {and} popular {flavor} {be} also needed
Modern {apple} {be} usually {sweet} than {old} cultivars
This {be} because popular {taste} {in} {apple} have become different
Most {North America}ns {and} {Europe}ans enjoy {sweet} apples
{and} India

{Algebra} {be} {a} part {of} {mathematics} often called {list of mathematics topics} {in} {the} {United States} {and} {maths} or numeracy {in} {the} {United Kingdom} 
It uses {variable}s {to} represent {a} {value} that {be} {not} yet known
When {a} {equals sign}  {be} used this {be} called {a} {equation}
A very {simple} {equation} using {a} {variable} is    In this example  or it could also {be} said x {equal} five
This {be} called solving for x
Besides equations there {be} {inequality} less than {and} greater than
A special type {of} {equation} {be} called {the} function
This {be} often used {in} making {graph}s because it always turns {one} input into {one} output
{Algebra} can {be} used {to} solve {reality} {problem} because {the} {rule} {of} {algebra} {Employment} {in} {reality} {life} {and} {number} can {be} used {to} represent {the} {value} {of} {reality} things
{Physics} {engineering} {and} {computer programming} {be} {area} that use {algebra} all {the} time
It {be} also useful {to} know {in} {surveying} {construction} {and} {business} especially {accounting}
People who do {algebra} use {the} {rule} {of} {number}s {and} mathematic {operation mathematics} used on numbers
The {simple} {be} {addition} {subtraction} {multiplication} {and} {division mathematics}
More advanced {operation mathematics} involve {exponent}s {start} with {square algebra} {and} {square root}s
{Algebra} {be} first used {to} solve {algebraic equation} {and} inequalities
Two {example} {be} {linear equation}s the {equation} {of} {a} {straight} line  {and} {quadratic equation}s which has {variable} that {be} {Square algebra} multiplied by itself for example 
{Early Middle Ages} {form} {of} {algebra} {be} developed by {the} {Babylonian}s {and} {the} {Ancient Greece}
However {the} {word} algebra {be} {a} {Latin language} {form} {of} {the} {Arabic language} {word} AlJabr casting {and} comes from {a} {mathematics} {book} AlMaqala fi Hisabal Jabr waalMuqabilah Essay on {the} {Computation} {of} Casting {and} Equation {write} {in} {the} {9th century} by {a} {Iran} mathematician {Muhammad ibn Ms alKhwrizm} who {be} {a} {Islam} born {in} {Khwarizm} {in} {Uzbekistan}
He flourished {under} AlMamoun {in} {Baghdad} {Iraq} through 813833 AD {and} {death} around 840 AD
The {book} {be} brought into {Europe} {and} {translation} into {Latin} {in} {the} {12th century}
The {book} {be} then given {the} {name} Algebra The ending {of} {the} mathematicians name alKhwarizmi {be} changed into {a} {word} easier {to} say {in} Latin {and} became {the} {English language} {word} {algorithm}
Here {be} {a} {simple} {example} {of} {a} {algebra} problem  
Sue has 12 candies Ann has 24  
candies
They decide {to} share so that they have {the} same {number} {of} candies
These {be} {the} steps {you} can use {to} solve {the} problem   To have {the} same {number} {of} candies Ann has {to} give some {to} Sue
Let x represent {the} {number} {of} {candy} Ann gives {to} Sue
 Sues candies plus x must {be} {the} same {as} Anns {candy} minus x
This {Chinese characters} as    Subtract 12 from both {side} {of} {the} equation
This gives 
What happens on {one} {side} {of} {the} {equals sign} must happen on {the} other {side} too for {the} {equation} {to} {still} {be} true
So {in} this case when 12 {be} subtracted from both sides there {be} {a} {middle} step {of} 
After {a} {person} {be} comfortable with this {the} {middle} step {be} {not} {write} down  Add x {to} both {side} {of} {the} equation
This gives   Divide both {side} {of} {the} {equation} by 2
This gives 
The answer {be} six
If Ann gives Sue 6 candies they {will} have {the} same {number} {of} candies  To {check} this put 6 {back} into {the} original {equation} wherever x was   This gives  which {be} true
They both {now} have 18 candies
With practice {algebra} can {be} used when {face} with {a} {problem} that {be} too hard {to} solve any other way
Problems such {as} {building} {a} freeway {design} {a} {cell} phone or finding {the} cure for {a} {disease} all require algebra
{As} {in} most {computer hardware} {of} mathematics {addition} z {to} y or y plus z {Chinese characters} {as} 
Subtracting z from y or y minus z {Chinese characters} {as} 
Dividing y by z or y over z  {Chinese characters} {as}  or 
{be} more commonly used
In algebra {multiplication} y by z or y {time} z can {be} {write} {in} 4 ways    or just 
The {multiplication} {symbol}  {be} usually {not} used because it looks too much {like} {the} {letter} x which {be} often used {as} {a} variable
Also when {multiplication} {a} larger expression parentheses can {be} used 
When we multiply {a} {number} {and} {a} {letter} {in} algebra we {write} {the} {number} {in} front {of} {the} letter 
When {the} {number} {be} 1 then {the} 1 {be} {not} {write} because 1 {time} any {number} {be} that {number} 1  y  y {and} so it {be} {not} needed
{As} {a} {side} note {you} do {not} have {to} use {the} {letter} x or y {in} algebra
Variables {be} just {symbol} that mean some unknown {number} or value so {you} can use any variable x {and} y {be} {the} most common though
An important part {of} {algebra} {be} {the} {research} {of} {Function mathematics} since {Function mathematics} often appear {in} {algebraic equation} that we {be} trying {to} solve
A {Function mathematics} {be} {like} {a} {machine} {you} can put {a} {number} or numbers into {and} get {a} certain {number} or numbers out
When using functions {graph}s can {be} powerful {tool} {in} {help} us {to} {research} {the} {solution} {to} equations
A {graph} {be} {a} {picture} that shows all {the} {value} {of} {the} {variable} that make {the} {equation} or {inequality} true
Usually this {be} easy {to} make when there {be} only {one} or two variables
The {graph} {be} often {a} line {and} {if} {the} {line} does {not} bend or {go} {straight} upanddown it can {be} described by {the} basic formula 
The {variable} b {be} {the} {yintercept} {of} {the} {graph} where {the} {line} {crucifix} {the} {vertical} axis {and} m {be} {the} {mathematics} or steepness {of} {the} line
This formula applies {to} {the} {Cartesian coordinate system} {of} {a} graph where each {point} on {the} {line} {Chinese characters} 
In some {list of mathematics topics} {problem} {like} {the} {equation} for {a} line there can {be} more than {one} {variable} x {and} y {in} this case
To find {point} on {the} line {one} {variable} {be} changed
The {variable} that {be} changed {be} called {the} independent variable
Then {the} {list of mathematics topics} {be} done {to} make {a} number
The {number} that {be} made {be} called {the} dependent variable
Most {of} {the} {time} {the} {Independence} {variable} {Chinese characters} {as} x {and} {the} dependent {variable} {Chinese characters} {as} y for example {in} 
This {be} often put on {a} graph using {a} x axis going {left} {and} right {and} {a} y axis going {up} {and} down
It can also {be} {write} {in} {Function mathematics} form 
So {in} this example we could put {in} 5 for x {and} get 
Put {in} {February 2} for x would get 
And 0 for x would get 
So there would {be} {a} {line} going thru {the} {point} 516 27 {and} 01 {as} {see} {in} {the} {graph} {to} {the} right
If x has {a} {power} {of} 1 it {be} {a} {straight} line
If it {be} {Square algebra} or some other power it {will} {be} curved
If it uses {a} {inequality}  {be}   Reciprocal  {the} reciprocal {of}  {be}

{Astronomy} {be} {a} {natural science}
It {be} {the} {research} {of} everything outside {the} {atmosphere of Earth}
It {Research} {Astronomical object} such {as} {star}s {Galaxy} {planet}s {natural satellite}s  {asteroid}s {comet}s {and} {nebula}e {and} {process} such {as} {supernova} {gamma ray burst}s {and} {cosmic microwave background radiation}
This includes {the} {physics} {chemistry} {of} those {Object grammar} {and} processes
The {word} {astronomy} comes from {the} {Ancient Greece} {word} astron which means {star} {and} nomos which means {law}
A {person} who {Research} {astronomy} {be} called {a} astronomer
{Astronomy} {be} {one} {of} {the} {old} {science}s
Ancient {people} used {the} {position} {of} {the} {star} {to} navigate {and} {to} find when {be} {the} best {time} {to} {plant} {crops}
{Astronomy} {be} very similar {to} {astrophysics}
A related subject {physical cosmology} {be} concerned with {research} {the} {Universe} {as} {a} whole {and} {the} way {the} {universe} changed over time
{Astronomy} {be} {not} {the} same {as} {astrology} {the} {belief} that {the} {pattern} {the} {star} {and} {the} {planet} {may} affect {human} lives
Since {the} {20th century} there have {be} two main types {of} astronomy observational {and} {theory} astronomy
Observational {astronomy} uses {telescope}s {and} {camera}s {to}  or look at stars {Galaxy} {and} other {astronomy} objects
Theoretical {astronomy} uses {maths} {and} {computer model}s {to} {predict} what should happen
The two often {Employment} together {the} {theory} {predict} what should happen {and} {the} observational shows whether {the} prediction works
{Early Middle Ages} {astronomer} used only their {eye} {to} look at {the} stars
They made {map}s {of} {the} {constellation}s {and} {star} for religious reasons {and} {calendar}s {to} {Employment} {out} {the} {time} {of} year
{Early Middle Ages} civilisations such {as} {the} {Maya civilization} {people} {and} {the} {Ancient Egypt}ians built {simple} {observatory} {and} {draw} {map} {of} {the} {star} positions
They also began {to} think about {the} place {of} {Earth} {in} {the} {universe}
For {a} {long} {time} {people} {thought} {Earth} {be} {the} center {of} {the} universe {and} that {the} planets {the} {star} {and} {the} {sun} {go} around it
This {be} known {as} {geocentrism}
{Ancient Greeks} tried {to} explain {the} {motion physics} {of} {the} {sun} {and} {star} by taking measurements
A {mathematician} {name} {Eratosthenes} {be} {the} first who {measure} {the} {size} {of} {the} {Earth} {and} proved that {the} {Earth} {be} {a} {sphere}
A {theory} by another {mathematician} {name} {Aristarchus} was that {the} {sun} {be} {in} {the} center {and} {the} {Earth} {be} moving around it
This {be} known {as} {heliocentrism}
Only {a} few {people} {thought} it {be} right
The rest continued {to} believe {in} {the} geocentric model
Most {of} {the} {name} {of} {constellation} {and} {star} come from {Ancient Greece} {of} that time
{Arabic language} {astronomer} made many advancements during {the} {Middle Ages} including improved {star} {map} {and} ways {to} estimate {the} {size} {of} {the} Earth
They also learned from {the} {Ancient history} by translating {Ancient Greece} {book} into Arabic
{the Moon} by {Galileo Galilei}
His {drawing} {be} more detailed than anyone before him because {he} used {a} {telescope} {to} look at {the Moon} During {the} {renaissance} {a} {priest} {name} {Nicolaus Copernicus} thought from looking at {the} way {the} {planet} moved that {the} {Earth} {be} {not} {the} center {of} everything
Based on previous works {he} said that {the} {Earth} {be} {a} {planet} {and} all {the} {planet} {Movement} around {the} sun
This brought {back} {the} {old} {idea} {of} heliocentrism
A physicist called {Galileo Galilei} built his {own} {telescope}s {and} used them {to} look more closely at {the} {star} {and} {planet} for {the} first time
He agreed with Copernicus
The {Catholic Church} decided that {Galileo Galilei} {be} wrong
He had {to} spend {the} rest {of} his {life} {under} {house arrest}
Heliocentric {idea} {be} soon improved by {Johannes Kepler} {and} {Isaac Newton} who {invent} {the} {theory} {of} {gravity}
After Galileo {people} made better {telescope} {and} used them {to} {see} farther {Object grammar} such {as} {the} {planet} {Uranus} {and} {Neptune}
They also saw how {star} {be} similar {to} our Sun but {in} {a} range {of} {color} {and} sizes
They also saw {thousand} {of} other faraway {Object grammar} such {as} {Galaxy} {and} {nebula}e
The {20th century} saw important changes {in} astronomy
In 1931 Karl Jansky discovered {radio} {toxic} from outside {the} {Earth} when trying {to} isolate {a} {source} {of} {noise} {in} {radio} communications {mark} {the} {birth} {of} {radio astronomy} {and} {the} first attempts at using another part {of} {the} {electromagnetic spectrum} {to} {Astronomy} {the} sky
Those {computer hardware} {of} {the} {electromagnetic spectrum} that {the} {atmosphere} did {not} block {be} {now} opened {up} {to} astronomy allowing more {discovery} {to be} made
The opening {of} this {new} {window} on {the} {Universe} saw {the} {discovery} {of} entirely {new} things for {example} {pulsar}s which sent regular pulses {of} {radio} {wave} {out} into space
The {wave} {be} first {thought} {to be} alien {in} origin because {the} pulses {be} so regular that it implied {a} artificial source
The period {after} {World War 2} saw more {observatory} where large {and} accurate {telescope} {be} built {and} operated at {goodness} {Astronomy} sites normally by governments
For example {Bernard Lovell} began {radio astronomy} at Jodrell Bank using leftover {military} {radar} equipment
By 1957 {the} site had {the} largest steerable {radio} {telescope} {in} {the} world
Similarly {the} end {of} {the} {1960} saw {the} {start} {of} {the} {building} {of} dedicated {observatory} at {Mauna Kea} {in} {Hawaii} {a} {goodness} site for visible {and} {infrared} {telescope} thanks {to} its high altitude {and} {clear} skies
The next great {revolution} {in} {astronomy} {be} thanks {to} {the} {birth} {of} rocketry
This allowed {telescope} {to be} placed {in} {Outer space} on {satellite artificial}
{Space observatory} gave access for {the} first {time} {in} history {to} {the} entire {electromagnetic spectrum} including {ray} that had {be} blocked by {the} atmosphere
The {Xray}s {gamma ray}s {ultraviolet} {light} {and} {computer hardware} {of} {the} {infrared} spectrum {be} all opened {to} {astronomy} {as} {Astronomy} {telescope} {be} launched
{As} with other {computer hardware} {of} {the} spectrum {new} {discovery} {be} made
From {1970} {satellite artificial} {be} launched {to be} replaced with more accurate {and} better satellites causing {the} {sky} {to be} {map} {in} nearly all {computer hardware} {of} {the} electromagnetic spectrum
Discoveries broadly come {in} two types  {bodies} {and} phenomena
Bodies {be} things {in} {the} Universe whether it {be} {a} {planet} {like} our {Earth} or {a} {galaxy} {like} our Milky Way
Phenomena {be} {event} {and} happenings {in} {the} Universe

Acceleration {be} {a} {measure} {of} how {speed} {velocity} 
Acceleration {be} {the} change {of} {velocity} {Division mathematics}d by {the} change {of} {time}

After Sally {walk} {east} at 15 {kilometer} per hour
Sally has had {a} nonzero acceleration 
{Acceleration due to gravity}    Acceleration {be} {the} {rate mathematics} {of} change {of} {the} {velocity} {of} {a} object
Acceleration  can {be} found by using  where  {be} {the} {velocity} at {the} {start}  {be} {the} {velocity} at {the} end  {be} {the} {time} at {the} {start}   {be} {the} {time} at {the} end   Sometimes {the} change {in} {velocity}  {Chinese characters} {as} 
Sometimes {the} change {in} {time}  {Chinese characters} {as} t
In difficult situations {the} acceleration can {be} calculated using {mathematics} {in} {calculus} acceleration {be} {the} {Derivative mathematics} {of} {the} {velocity} with respect {to} time 
Acceleration has its {own} {units of measurement}
For example {if} {velocity} {be} {measure} {in} {metre} per second {and} {if} {time} {be} {measure} {in} seconds then acceleration {be} {measure} {in} {metre} per {second} {Square algebra}  ms
Acceleration can {be} {positive} or {negative number}
When {the} acceleration {be} {negative number} but {the} {velocity} does {not} change direction it {be} sometimes called deceleration
For example when {a} {car} {brake} it decelerates
Physicists usually only use {the} {word} acceleration
Newtons {laws} {of} {motion physics} {be} {rule}s for how things {Movement}
These {rule} {be} called {law}s {of} {motion physics}
{Isaac Newton} {be} {the} {scientist} who first {write} {down} {the} main {laws} {of} motion
According {to} {Newtons laws of motionSecond Law} {the} {Force physics} something {need} {to} accelerate {a} {Object grammar} depends on {the} {Object grammar} {mass} the {amount} {of} stuff {the} {Object grammar} {be} made from or how heavy it is
The formula {of} {Newtons laws of motionSecond Law} {be}  where  {be} {the} acceleration  {be} {the} force {and}  {the} mass
This formula {be} very wellknown {and} it {be} very important {in} {physics}
Newtons Second {Law} {of} Motion {in} {short} Newtons Second Law {be} often {one} {of} {the} first things that {physics} {student} learn
Deceleration {be} {the} {opposite} {of} acceleration
This means that something {slow} {down} instead {of} {speed} up
For example when {a} {car} brakes it {be} decelerating
{Ancient Rome} {theatre} {in} {Alexandria} {Egypt}  Archaeology or archeology {be} {the} {research} {of} {the} {past} by looking for {the} remains {and} {Object grammar} {left} by {the} {people} who lived {long} ago
These remains can include {old} {coin}s {tool}s {building}s {and} inscriptions
Archaeologists {the} {people} who {research} archaeology use these remains {to} {knowledge} how {people} lived
When {archaeologist} do fieldwork they look for remains often by digging {in} {the} ground
{As} {Human settlement} places where {people} lived {in} groups change {and} grow {old} {building} get buried
Usually this {be} {a} {natural} process
A typical {student} project {be} {to} leave {a} {Object grammar} {in} {a} place where there {be} nothing going on
It {will} get {cover} rather quickly because wind {water} {and} {plants} {will} bury it
Sometimes {building} {be} deliberately {burial} {to} make way for {new} buildings
Ancient {Rome} for example {be} {now} {up} {to} 40feet 12metres below {the} present city
This {process} {of} {natural} or manmade {burial} {be} why {archaeology} fieldwork involves digging {and} {be} expensive {and} takes {a} {long} time
When things {be} found or {even} when nothing {be} found {the} results {of} {the} fieldwork {be} taken {back} {to} {a} base
Short term {the} {base} {be} often on or {near} {the} site
Longer term {the} results {will} usually {go} {to} {a} {university} or {museum}
Everything {Chinese characters} {down} on {paper} or entered into {a} computer
Gradually they build {up} {a} {picture} {of} what happened {long} ago
{Archaeology} publish their {research} so {Ethnic groups in Afghanistan} can {knowledge} what they learned
{Archaeologist}s do {not} all {research} {the} same topics
They have specialties
Some {field} {of} {interest} include {Ancient Egypt} these specialists {be} called {Egyptologist}s {Ancient China} or {the} {Vikings}
{Archaeology} {research} every {civilization} that {be} known especially {the} {one} where there {be} {no} {write} {history}
They can {research} any {time} period
For example {one} might {research} {the} {human evolution} {in} Africa or {research} {World War II}
Marine {archaeologist} {research} things that {be} {now} underwater
They search for {shipwreck} or {city} that have {be} lost {under} {the} sea
There {be} many {different} ways {of} doing archaeology these depend on {the} methods used {the} things studied {and} {the} environment
Some {of} these subdisciplines overlap with each other
{Archaeology} relating {to} oceans {sea} {and} {lake} {be} usually done underwater
It includes {the} {research} {of} {shipwreck} {and} submerged coastlines Maritime archaeology {be} {a} part {of} this subdivision
It refers {to} {the} {archaeology} investigation {of} {past} {ship} {and} seafaring
A famous {example} {of} maritime {archaeology} {be} {the} recovery {and} restoration {of} {the} {ship} {burial} at {Sutton Hoo}
When {a} {glacier} melts {Object grammar} that {be} {capture} {in} it {be} revealed
The recovery {and} {research} {of} these {Object grammar} {be} called icepatch archaeology
A famous {example} {be} {tzi the Iceman}
Historical {archaeology} deals with places things {and} issues from {the} {past} or present at or related {to} sites with {write} {record} or oral traditions
Or it can {be} defined {as} the {archaeology} investigation {of} any {past} {culture} that has developed {a} literate tradition
 A prominent {example} {of} {history} {archaeology} {be} {the} {Employment} done at {Historic Williamsburg}
This relatively {new} {branch} {of} {archaeology} consists {of} the systematic {research} {of} {structure} {and} artefacts {as} {a} means {of} enlarging our understanding {of} {the} industrial past
   Archaeozoology or zooarchaeology {be} {the} {research} {of} {the} relationships between {humans} {and} {animals} {in} {the} {archaeology} record
This includes {the} {research} {of} bones feathers {tooth} {and} other {body} {computer hardware} {as} {well} {as} their interpretation
This {field} involves attempts at replicating {the} actions {and} {condition} {of} {Ancient history} cultures
Good {example} {be} {Butser Ancient Farm} {Overton Down}
In many countries {government}s {and} other {group} {of} {people} protect important {archaeological site}s so they {will} {not} {be} destroyed {and} so that visitors can always come {and} {see} them
Sometimes {archaeological site} {be} found when {Foundation engineering}s {be} dug for {new} {building}s
{Archaeology} have {to} {Employment} quickly when this happens because {people} who {be} {building} often dont have {a} lot {of} time
{As} soon {as} {the} {archaeologist} {be} done with their work {the} remains that they have found {will} {be} {cover} over unless they {be} very important

These native Australians {be} called {the} {Australian Aborigine}s
For {the} {history} {of} Australia {see} {History of Australia}
Most {of} {the} Australian colonies having {be} settled from {Britain} became mostly {Independence} {democracy} {States of Australia} {in} {the} 1850s {and} all six combined {as} {a} {federation} on 1 {January} 1901

{Corroboree} {in} {1900}  The {Australian Aborigine} {people} arrived {in} {Australia} about 50000 {year} ago or {even} earlier
Until {the} arrival {of} {Britain} {settler} {in} 1788 {the} Aboriginal {people} lived by {hunting} {and} gathering {food} from {the} land
They lived {in} all {sort} {of} {climate} {and} managed {the} {land} {in} {different} ways
An {example} {of} Aboriginal {land} management {be} {the} {Cumberland Plain} where {Sydney} {be} now
Every few {year} {the} Aboriginal {people} would {burn} {the} {grass} {and} {small} trees
This meant that {a} lot {of} {grass} {cell growth} back but {not} many big trees
Kangaroos {like} {to} live on grassy plains but {not} {in} forests
The {kangaroo} that lived on {the} plain {be} {a} {goodness} {food} supply for {the} Aboriginal people

The Aboriginal {people} did {not} use {metal} or make {pottery} or use bows {and} arrows or weave cloth
In some {computer hardware} {of} {Australia} {the} {people} used {sharp} flakedstone spearheads but most Aboriginal spears {be} made {of} sharply {point} wood
{Australia} has {a} lot {of} {tree graph theory} that have very hard {wood} that {be} {goodness} for spear making
The {boomerang} {be} used {in} some {area} for {sport} {and} for hunting
The Aboriginal {people} did {not} think that {the} {land} belonged {to} them
They believed that they had grown from {the} land so it {be} {like} their mother {and} they belonged {to} {the} land
In {the} 1600s {Dutch people} {merchant} {trade} with {the} {island} {of} {Batavia} now {Indonesia} {to} {the} {north} {of} {Australia} {and} several {different} {Dutch people} {ship} {touch} on {the} {coast} {of} Australia
The {Dutch people} governor van Diemen sent {Abel Tasman} on {a} voyage {of} {discovery} {and} {he} found {Tasmania} which {he} {name} {Van Diemens Land}
Its {name} {be} later changed {to} honour {the} {man} who discovered it
The {British Government} {be} sure that there must {be} {a} very large {land} {in} {the} south that had {not} {be} explored
They sent Captain {James Cook} {to} {the} {Pacific Ocean}
His ship {HMS Endeavour} carried {the} famous scientists Sir {Joseph Banks} {and} Dr Solander who {be} going {to} {Tahiti} where they would {watch} {the} {planet} {Venus planet} pass {in} front {of} {the} {Sun}
Captain Cooks {secret} mission {be} {to} find {Terra Australis} the Land {of} {the} South
The voyage {of} {discovery} {be} very successful because they found {New Zealand} {and} {sail} {right} around it
Then they {sail} westward
At last {a} boy William Hicks who {be} {up} {the} mast spotted {land} on {the} {horizon}
Captain Cook {name} that {bit} {of} {land} {Point Hicks}
They {sail} {up} {the} {coast} {and} Captain Cook {name} {the} {land} that {he} saw New {South} Wales
At last they {sail} into {a} large open {bay} which {be} full {of} {fish} {and} stingrays which {the} sailors speared for food
{Joseph Banks} {and} Dr
Solander {go} ashore {and} {be} astonished {to} find that they did {not} know what any {of} {the} {plants} or {bird} or {animals} that they saw were
They collected {hundred} {of} {plants} {to} take {back} {to} England
Captain Cook saw {the} Aboriginal {people} with their {simple} way {of} life
He saw them {fishing} {and} {hunting} {and} collecting {grass} {seeds} {and} fruit
But there {be} {no} {house} {and} {no} fences
In most {computer hardware} {of} {the} world {people} put {up} {a} {house} {and} {a} {fence} or some marker {to} show that they {own} {the} land
But {the} Aboriginal {people} did {not} {own} {the} {land} {in} that way
They belonged {to} {the} land {like} {a} {baby} belongs {to} its mother
Captain Cook {go} home {to} {England} {and} told {the} {government} that noone {ownership} {the} land
This would later cause {a} terrible {problem} for {the} Aboriginal people
{Arthur Phillip} raises {the} {Britain} {flag} at {Sydney} {in} {1788}  In {the} 1700s {in} England {laws} {be} tough many {people} {be} {Poverty} {and} {gaol}s {jail}s {be} full
A {person} could {be} {sentence} {to} {death} for {steal} {a} loaf {of} bread
Many {people} {be} hung for {small} crimes
But usually they {be} just thrown {in} gaol
Often they {be} sent away {to} {the} {Britain} {colony} {in} America
But by {the} 1770s {the} {colony} {in} America became {the} United States
They {be} {free} from {Britain} {rule} {and} would {not} take {England} {convict} any more so {England} {need} {to} find {a} {new} {and} less populated place
By {the} 1780s {the} {gaol} {of} {England} {be} so full that {convict} {be} often {chain} {up} {in} rotting {old} ships
The {government} decided {to} make {a} settlement {in} {New South Wales} {and} send some {of} {the} {convict} there
In {1788} {the} {First Fleet} {of} eleven {ship} set {sail} from {Portsmouth} carrying convicts sailors marines {a} few {free} {settler} {and} enough {food} {to} last for two years
Their {leader} {be} Captain {Arthur Phillip}
They {be} {to} make {a} {new} {colony} at {the} place that Captain Cook had discovered {name} {Botany Bay} because {of} all {the} unknown {plants} found there by {the} two scientists
Captain Phillip found that {Botany Bay} {be} {flat} {and} windy
There {be} {not} much fresh water
He {go} with two {ship} {up} {the} {coast} {and} {sail} into {a} great {harbor} which {he} said {be} the {fine} {harbor} {in} {the} world
 There {be} many {small} {bay} on {the} {harbor} so {he} decided on {one} which had {a} {goodness} stream {of} {fresh water} {and} some {flat} shore {to} {land} on
On 26 {January} 1788 {the} {flag} {be} raised {and} {New South Wales} {be} claimed {in} {the} {name} {of} {George III of the United Kingdom} {of} England {and} {the} {new} settlement {be} called Sydney
For {the} first few {year} {of} {the} settlement things {be} very difficult
Noone {in} {the} {British Government} had {thought} very hard about what {sort} {of} {convict} should {be} sent {to} make {a} {new} colony
Nobody had {choice} them carefully
There {be} only {one} {man} who {be} {a} farmer
There {be} noone among {the} {convict} who {be} {a} builder {a} brickmaker or {a} blacksmith
Noone knew how {to} fix {the} {tool} when they broke
All {of} {the} cattle escaped
There {be} {no} {cooking} pots
All {the} {plants} {be} {different} so noone knew which {one} could {be} eaten
It {be} probable that everyone {in} {the} {new} {colony} would {death} {of} starvation
Somehow {the} {little} {group} {of} tents with {a} hut for {the} Governor Arthur Phillip {and} another hut for {the} supply {of} food {cell growth} into {a} {small} {town} with streets {a} {bridge} over {the} stream {a} windmill for grinding {grain} {and} wharves for ships
By {the} {1820} there {be} {a} {fine} {brick} {house} for {the} Governor
There {be} also {a} {hospital} {and} {a} {convict} barracks {and} {a} {Beauty} {church} which {be} {still} standing today
Settlements had spread {out} from Sydney firstly {to} {Norfolk Island} {and} {to} {Van Diemens Land} Tasmania {and} also {up} {the} {coast} {to} Newcastle where {coal} {be} discovered {and} inland where {the} missing cattle {be} found {to} have grown {to} {a} large herd
{Spanish language} Merino {sheep} had {be} brought {to} Sydney {and} by 1820 {farmers} {be} raising {fat} lambs for {meat} {and} also sending {fine} {wool} {back} {to} {the} {factory} {of} England
While {the} settlement {be} {cell growth} {in} New {South} Wales it {be} also {cell growth} {in} Tasmania
The {climate} {in} {Tasmania} {be} more {like} that {in} England {and} {farmers} found it easy {to} {cell growth} {crops} there
{Lachlan Macquarie} {be} {the} 5th {governor of New South Wales} {and} {one} who though that {Australia} could {be} {a} rich {and} {free} place  Because {Australia} {be} such {a} very large land it {be} easy {to} think that it might {be} able {to} hold {a} very large {number} {of} people
In {the} early {day} {of} {the} colony {a} great {number} {of} explorers {go} out searching for {goodness} {land} {to} settle on
When {the} {settler} looked {west} from Sydney they saw {a} range {of} {mountains} which they called {the} {Blue Mountains New South Wales}
They {be} {not} very high {and} did {not} look very rugged but for many {year} noone could find their way through them
In 1813 {Gregory Blaxland} {William Lawson explorer} {and} {a} 17yearold called {William Charles Wentworth} {crucifix} {the} {Blue Mountains New South Wales} {and} found {land} on {the} other {side} which {be} {goodness} for farming
A {road} {be} built {and} {the} governor {Lachlan Macquarie} founded {the} {town} {of} {Bathurst New South Wales} on {the} other side 100miles from Sydney
Some people {like} Captain {Charles Sturt} {be} sure that there must {be} {a} {sea} {in} {the} {middle} {of} {Australia} {and} set {out} {to} find it
Many {of} {the} explorers did {not} prepare very well or else they {go} {out} {to} explore at {the} {Heat} {time} {of} year
Some {death} {like} Burke {and} Wills
{Ludwig Leichhardt} got lost twice
The {second} time {he} {be} never {see} again
Major {Thomas Mitchell} {be} {one} {of} {the} most successful explorers
He {map} {the} {country} {as} {he} went {and} his {map} remained {in} use for more than 100 years
He {travel} all {the} way {to} what {be} {now} western Victoria {and} {to} his {surprise} {and} annoyance found that {he} {be} {not} {the} first {white} {person} there
The {Henty Brothers} had come from {Tasmania} had built themselves {a} house had {a} successful {farm} {and} fed {the} Major {and} his {man} on {roast} lamb {and} wine
The {gold} rushes {of} {New South Wales} {and} {Victoria Australia} {start} {in} {1851} leading {to} large {number} {of} {people} arriving {to} search for gold
The {population} {cell growth} {across} {south} {east} {Australia} {and} made great {wealth} {and} industry
By 1853 {the} {gold} rushes had made some {Poverty} people very rich
The {transportation} {of} {convict} {to} {Australia} ended {in} {the} {1840} {and} 1850s {and} more changes came
The {people} {in} {Australia} {want} {to} run their {own} country {and} {not} {be} told what {to} do from London
{2017 Westminster attack} {governments} {in} {the} {colony} {be} run by governors {choice} by London
Soon {the} {settler} {want} {local government} {and} more democracy
{William Wentworth} {start} {the} Australian Patriotic Association Australias first {political} party {in} 1835 {to} demand {Parliamentary democracy}
In 1840 {the} {city council} {start} {and} some {people} could vote

Bankruptcy {be} {a} {law} which happens when {a} {person} or {a} {organisation} does {not} have enough {money} {to} pay all {of} its {debt}s
Legally they {be} {Insolvency}
Where it {be} {a} {person} who cannot pay their debts {the} persons {creditor} {may} ask {the} {court} {to} appoint {a} trustee {in} bankruptcy
This {be} {a} professional {accountant} who {be} appointed by {the} court {and} they {will} take {control} {of} {the} bankrupt persons assets
Some {asset} {be} protected by law but {the} trustee {in} bankruptcy {will} {sales} off all {of} {the} other {asset} {and} use {the} proceeds {to} pay {as} much {of} that persons {debt} {as} possible
After {the} {process} {be} complete {the} {person} {be} discharged from bankruptcy {and} {the} {person} {be} {free} from any further liability {to} pay those claims but normally that {person} {will} {be} {limit} {in} their {ability} {to} borrow {money} {again} because their {credit} {rating} {will} {be} damaged
Where it {be} {a} {organisation} who cannot pay their debts {the} {creditor} {may} ask {the} {court} {to} appoint {a} liquidator
The liquidator does {a} very similar {job} {to} {the} trustee {in} bankruptcy except that there {be} {no} {asset} which {be} protected so {the} liquidator can {sales} everything
Once all {of} {the} {asset} {of} {the} {organisation} have {be} sold {the} {organisation} {be} then dissolved {and} {no} longer exists

Bankruptcy {be} {a} {formal} {law} {in} front {of} {the} courts
Although {the} two {term} {be} connected just because {a} {person} {be} {Insolvency} does {not} necessarily mean that they {will} {go} into bankruptcy

In many {country} {a} {company} or {business} can ask {the} {court} for bankruptcy protection {to} try {and} protect {the} {business} so that {the} {creditor}s cannot destroy all {of} {the} {physical capital} {and} {goodwill} by breaking it apart {and} moving it away
The aim {of} this {be} provide {be} more {time} for {the} {business} {to} reorganise itself {and} {to} {Employment} {out} {a} {new} deal between {the} {owner} {and} {the} {people} {the} {business} owes money
In many {country} this {be} called going into administration
However {not} all {country} have bankruptcy protection {laws} for businesses

This {be} {a} {human rights} {problem} {in} some countries
It {be} also called {liquidation} bankruptcy because some {of} {a} {debtor} {property} {may} {be} sold liquidated {to} satisfy creditors

A Chapter 11 bankruptcy case allows {a} {business} {to} keep running while it finds ways {to} reduce {and} arrange payment {of} its debts
Almost all Chapter 11 bankruptcies {be} {Computer file} by businesses
Ordinary {people} do {not} usually {Computer file} Chapter 11 bankruptcy because {a} Chapter {July 13} bankruptcy {will} almost always {be} cheaper {and} easier for them

       MedlinePlus      000596  Bubonic {plague} {be} {the} bestknown {form} {of} {the} {disease} {plague} which {be} caused by {the} {bacterium} {Yersinia pestis}
The {name} bubonic {plague} {be} specific for this {form} {of} {the} disease which enters through {the} skin {and} {travel} through {the} {lymphatic system}
If {the} {disease} {be} {left} untreated it {kill} about half its victims {in} between three {and} seven days
The bubonic {plague} {be} {the} {disease} that caused {the} {Black Death} which {kill} {ten} {of} {million} {of} {people} {in} Europe {in} {the} {Middle Ages}
{Symptom}s {of} this {disease} include {cough}ing {fever} {and} {black} spots on {the} {skin}
There {be} {different} {kind} {of} Bubonic plague
The most {Common year} {form} {of} {the} {disease} {be} spread by {a} certain {kind} {of} {flea} that lives on {rat}s
Then there {be} {a} {incubation period} which can last from {a} few {hour} {to} about seven days
{Sepsis} happens when {the} {bacterium} enters {the} {blood} {and} makes it {form} tiny clots
This happens when {the} {bacterium} can enter {the} lungs
About 95 {of} all {people} with this {form} {will} die
Incubation period {be} only {one} {to} two days
This {be} {the} most harmless form
It {will} result {in} {a} {little} {fever}
After that there {be} {antibody} that protect {against} all {form} for {a} {long} time
During {the} 1300s this {epidemic} struck {computer hardware} {of} {Asia} {North Africa} {and} {Europe}
Almost {a} {third} {of} {the} {people} {in} {Europe} {death} {of} it
Unlike s that pull {community} together this {epidemic} {be} so terrifying that it broke {people} trust {in} {one} another
{Giovanni Boccaccio} {a} {Italy} {writer} {of} {the} time described it This  had implanted so great {a} terror {in} {the} {heart} {of} {man} {and} {woman} that {brother} ed brothers uncles their nephews {sister} their brothers {and} {in} many cases wives {desert} their husbands
But {even} worse
{father} {and} {mother} refused {to} {nurse} {and} assist their {own} children   {Oriental rat flea} Xenopsylla cheopis infected with {the} {Yersinia pestis} {Bacteria} which appears {as} {a} {dark} {mass} {in} {the} gut
The foregut {of} this {flea} {be} blocked by {a} Y pestis {biofilm} when {the} {flea} attempts {to} feed on {a} uninfected {Host biology} Y pestis from {the} foregut {be} {Regurgitation digestion} into {the} wound causing {infection} The {plague} {be} {not} just carried by {rat}s {as} some {people} assume
The {flea}s also carried it
It came from abroad from {Kaffa} by {the} {Black Sea}
From there {the} {disease} {start} {to} {go} {new} places {in} {1347}
It {go} {to} {England} {in} {1349}
There it {kill} half {of} {the} {people} {in} England
70 {of} {people} who got {plague} died
Pigs {be} also {to} blame for {the} transmission {as} {the} {bacteria} stayed {in} their {blood} system {and} when eaten {people} caught {the} plague
This {be} {a} reason why so few {Judaism} or {Muslims} caught {the} disease
In {the} {20th century} some {country} did {research} on {the} {bacteria} that causes bubonic plague
They did {research} {to} use it for {biological warfare}
Samples {of} this {bacteria} {be} carefully controlled
There {be} much {paranoia} fear about it

This {be} {the} {bacteria} that causes bubonic plague
The {FBI} did {not} find {the} samples

They do {not} use {light} {to} get {energy} {as} {plants} do
The {research} {of} {animals} {be} called {zoology}
{Animals} use {different} ways {to} get {energy} from other {living} things
They usually eat other {living} things but some {be} {parasitism} or have {photosynthesis} {protist}s {as} {symbiosis}
{Plants} {be} also {multicellular} {eukaryotic} {organism}s but most {animals} {be} {motile} {meaning} they can {Movement} around
{Animals} take {in} {oxygen} {and} give {out} {carbon dioxide}
This {cellular respiration} {be} part {of} their {metabolism} chemical working
In both these ways they {be} {different} from {plants}
Also {the} {cell} {of} {animals} have {different} {cell membrane}s {to} other {eukaryotes} {like} {plants} {and} {fungi}
There {be} many types {of} animals
The {Common year} {animals} most {people} know {be} only about 3 {of} {the} {animal} kingdom
When {biologists} look at animals they find things that certain {animals} have {in} common
They use this {to} {group} {the} {animals} {in} {a} {biological classification}
They think several {million} {species} exist but they have only identified about {one} million

The {animal} mode {of} {nutrition} {be} called {heterotroph}ic because they get their {food} from other {living} organisms
Some {animals} eat only plants they {be} called {herbivore}s
Other {animals} eat only {meat} {and} {be} called {carnivore}s
{Animals} that eat both {plants} {and} {meat} {be} called {omnivore}s
The {environments} {animals} live {in} vary greatly
By {the} {process} {of} {evolution} {animals} {Adaptation} {to} {the} {habitats} they live in
A {fish} {be} {Adaptation} {to} its {life} {in} {water} {and} {a} {spider} {be} {Adaptation} {to} {a} {life} catching {and} eating insects
A {mammal} {living} on {the} {savannah}s {of} {East Africa} lives quite {a} {different} {life} from {a} {sea mammal} like {a} {dolphin} or {porpoise} catching {fish} {in} {the} sea

In {Chinese language} {Beijing} {name} {Chinese characters} 
Today {people} spell it Beijing because they use {the} {pinyin} which shows what {the} {name} should {sound} {like} {in} {Mandarin Chinese}
People used {to} spell it Peking because that {be} {the} {spelling} used by some {of} {the} first {people} from {Europe} {to} visit {the} {Ming dynasty} {and} {write} home about it {the} {Jesuit China Mission} {Employment} {be} made popular by their {Kingdom of France} {brother} {JeanBaptiste du Halde}I p13 It then became {the} official {Chinese Postal Map} {spelling} around {1900} {and} continued {to be} used until {pinyin} became more popular
{Beijing} {be} also known {as} Beiping City {of} {Northern hemisphere} Peace between 1928 {and} 1949 when {the} {Kuomintang} {Movement} {the} {Chinese language} {capital city} {to} {Nanjing} {and} {Chongqing}
The center {of} {Beijing} {be} settled {in} {the} {1st millennium BC}
In those days {the} {Kingdom} {of} Yan  Yn set {up} their {capital city} where {Beijing} {be} today
They called it Ji  J
After {the} {Kingdom} {of} Yan {be} destroyed {the} {city} became smaller although it {be} {still} {a} important place
{Beijing} became more important {again} {in} {the} 10th century when {the} Jin {dynasty} set its {capital city} there
This {city} {be} destroyed by {Mongol} {Force physics} {in} {1215}
Then {in} {1267} {Mongol} built {a} {new} {city} on {the} {north} {side} {of} {the} Jin capital {and} called it Great Capital  Dd which {be} {the} beginning {of} modern Beijing
When {Kublai Khan} {the} Mongolian monarch set {up} {the} {Yuan Dynasty} dynasty this {city} became his capital
The {Yuan Dynasty} {Ming Dynasty} {and} {Qing dynasty} all made {Beijing} their capital
When {the} {Qing dynasty} lost {power} {and} {the} {Republic of China} {be} set up {the} {new} {Republic} {Movement} its {capital city} from {Beijing} {to} Nanjing

There {be} 196 {of} them {in} {the} world or 195 {if} {Taiwan} {be} {not} {Counting} {as} {a} {country} see {CountryTerritorial dispute}
Most {country} {in} {the} {world} {be} {sovereign state}s {meaning} they {be} {Independence} {of} each other
The {term} {be} most commonly used {as} both {a} {state} {and} {a} {nation}
193 {of} {the} {world} {country} {be} part {of} {the} {United Nations} which recognises lots {of} {country} {and} other {dependent territory}
A disputed {territory} {be} that {territory} whose {sovereignty} {be} jealously desired by two or more countries
Usually {the} {administration} {of} {the} {territory} {be} carried {out} by {one} {of} {the} {country} that claims sovereignty while {the} other {country} does {not} recognise {the} {sovereignty} over {the} {territory} {of} {the} other country
This does {not} usually happen {in} {land} or {sea} {area} on which none possesses effective control such {as} {Antarctica} or only partially
It can also {be} considered {as} {a} disputed {territory} {to} those {area} that {be} given by two {different} governments {and} therefore {be} divided

{Computer} {science} {be} {the} {research} {of} manipulating managing transforming {and} {code} {information}
There {be} many {different} {area} {in} {computer} science
Some {area} consider {problem} {in} {a} {Abstraction} manner while some {need} special {machine}s called {computer}s
A {person} who {Employment} with {computers} {will} often {need} {mathematics} {science} {and} {logic} {in} {order} {to} {design} {and} {Employment} with computers
This {be} so that they can find {new} {and} easier ways {to} do things {and} {the} way {to} approach {problem} with this information
{Computer} can do some things easily for example {simple} math or {sort} {out} {a} {list} {of} {name} from AtoZ
But {computers} cannot answer {question} when there {be} {not} enough information or when there {be} {no} {reality} answer
Also {computers} {may} take too much {time} {to} finish {long} 
For example it {may} take too {long} {to} find {the} {short} way through all {of} {the} {town} {in} {the} {United States}  so instead {a} {computer} {will} try {to} make {a} {heuristic}
A {computer} {will} answer these {simple} {question} much faster
{Algorithm}s {be} {a} specific set {of} instructions or steps on how {to} complete {a} task
For example {a} {computer scientist} {want} {to} {sort} {playing cards}
There {be} many ways {to} {sort} them  by suits diamonds clubs hearts {and} spades or by {number} 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King {and} Ace
By deciding on {a} set {of} steps {to} {sort} {the} cards {the} {scientist} has {create} {a} algorithm
The {scientist} then {need} {to} {test} whether this {algorithm} works
This shows how {well} {and} how {speed} {the} {algorithm} {sort} cards
A {simple} but {slow} {algorithm} is {drop} {the} cards pick them up {and} {check} whether they {be} sorted
If they {be} not do it again
This method {will} work but it {will} take {a} very {long} time
A better {algorithm} is find {the} first {card} with {the} {small} suit {and} {small} {number} 2 {of} diamonds {and} place it at {the} start
After this look for {the} {second} card {and} so on
This {algorithm} {be} much faster {and} does {not} {need} much space
This {sort} {algorithm} {be} called selection sort
{Ada Lovelace} {write} {the} first {computer} {algorithm} {in} 1843 for {a} {computer} that {be} never finished
{Computer} began during {World War II}
{Computer} {science} separated from {the} other {science} during {the} {1960} {and} 1970s
Now {computer science} has its {own} methods {and} has its {own} technical terms
It {be} related {to} {electrical engineering} {mathematics} {and} {language science}

{Chemistry} {be} {a} {branch} {of}  {science} that deals with {chemical element}s {and} {Chemical compound} {and} how these things {Employment} together
It {be} {the} {research} {of} {the} {material}s things that make {up} our {bodies} {and} everything {in} {the} {world} around us
Before 1600 {people} {research} {substance} {to} figure {out} how {to} do things such {as} turn {lead} into gold but {no} {one} managed {to} do that
This {be} called alchemy
Alchemists separated {the} {air} into many {computer hardware} {and} isolated {the} {noble gas}es from it
They also {process} special {Dietary mineral} from {a} {mine} {in} {Sweden} {to} get {rare earth metal}s
{Radioactivity} {be} also discovered
Today {chemist} have discovered 118 {different} elements
Some {be} very common {like} {oxygen}
Many {be} very rare {and} expensive {like} {platinum}
Some cannot {be} found on {earth} {and} can only {be} made {in} labs {like} {rutherfordium}
Since {the} 1920s {the} increased understanding {of} {physics} has changed chemists {theory} about {chemical reaction}s
With {small} {and} {speed} {computer}s {chemist} have built better {tool} for {Analytical chemistry} substances
These {tool} have {be} sent {to} {research} {chemicals} on {Mars}
{Police} also use those {tool} {to} {research} {evidence} from {crime} s
There {be} several types {of} chemistry
{Analytical chemistry} looks at which  {chemicals} {be} {in} things
For example looking at how much {arsenic} {be} {in} food
{Organic chemistry} looks at things that have {carbon} {in} them
For example making {acetylene}
{Inorganic chemistry} looks at things that do {not} have {carbon} {in} them
One {example} {be} making {a} {integrated circuit}
A large {area} {of} {chemistry} {be} {polymer chemistry}
This looks at plastics
One {example} {be} making {nylon}
Because {plastic} {be} made {of} carbon {polymer chemistry} {be} part {of} organic chemistry
Another {area} {be} {biochemistry}
This looks at {the} {chemistry} {of} {living} things
An {example} would {be} seeing how {arsenic} {poison} people
{Biochemistry} {be} also part {of} organic chemistry
There {be} many other {small} {branch} {of} chemistry
The basic {unit} {of} {a} {Chemical element} {be} called {a} {atom}
An {atom} {be} {the} {small} {building} block that {you} can {cut} {a} {Chemical element} into without {the} {Chemical element} breaking {down} turning into {a} {density} element for {example} through {nuclear fission} or {radioactive decay}
A {chemical compound} {be} {a} {substance} made {up} {of} two or more elements
In {a} compound two or more {atoms} {be} {Ligature typography} together {to} {form} {a} {molecule}
The tiniest speck {of} {dust} or {drop} {of} {liquid} that {one} can {see} {be} made {up} {of} many {million} or {billion} {of} these molecules
{Mixture}s {be} {substance}s where {chemicals} {be} {mixed} but {not} reacted
An {example} would {be} mixing {sand} {and} salt
This can {be} undone {again} {to} {produce} {sodium chloride} {and} {sand} separately
{Chemical compound} {be} changed by {a} {chemical industry} reaction
An {example} would {be} {heat} {sodium bicarbonate} {Common year} {baking} soda
It {will} make water {carbon dioxide} {and} {sodium carbonate}
This {reaction} cannot {be} undone
One very important concept {in} {chemistry} {be} that {different} {atoms} interact with {one} another {in} very specific proportions
For example two {hydrogen} {atoms} interacting with {one} {oxygen} {atom} {lead} {to} {the} {water} molecule HO
This relationship {be} known {as} {the} Law {of} constant proportions {and} {lead} {to} {the} {idea} {of} stoichiometry {a} {term} that refers {to} {the} ratios {of} {different} {atoms} {in} {chemical industry} compounds
For example {in} water there {be} always exactly {February 2} {hydrogen} {atoms} {to} 1 {oxygen} atom
In {carbon} dioxide there {be} exactly {February 2} {oxygen} {atoms} for 1 {carbon} atom
These relationships {be} described using {chemical industry} formulas such {as} HO  two {hydrogen} {atoms} {and} {one} {oxygen} atom {and} CO one {carbon} {atom} {and} two {oxygen} atoms
Because {atoms} {of} {different} {Chemical element} {Chemical reaction} with {one} another {in} very specific {proportion} but {atoms} {of} {different} {Chemical element} have {different} weights {chemist} often describe {the} {amount} {of} {different} {Chemical element} {and} {Chemical compound} {in} {term} {of} {the} {number} {of} moles
A mole {of} any {Chemical element} contains {the} same {number} {of} atoms  602214150000000000000000 atoms
The {atomic mass} {of} {a} {Chemical element} can {be} used {to} {see} how much {of} {the} {Chemical element} makes {a} mole
For example {the} {atomic mass} {of} {copper} {be} about 6355
That means about 6355 {gram}s {of} {copper} {metal} has {a} mole {of} atoms
The {atomic mass} {of} chlorine {be} about 3545
That means 3545 {gram} {of} chlorine has {a} mole {of} {atoms} {in} it
Moles can {be} used {to} {see} how many {molecules} {be} {in} {chemical industry} compounds too
{CopperII chloride} {be} {a} example
CuCl {be} its {chemical industry} formula
There {be} {one} {copper} {atom} 6355 {and} two chlorine {atoms} 3545  {February 2}  7090
Add all {the} molar {mass} {of} {the} {Chemical element} together {to} get {the} molar {mass} {of} {the} {chemical compound} 6355  7090  13445
That means {in} 13445 {gram} {of} copperII chloride there {be} {one} mole {of} copperII chloride molecules
This concept {be} used {to} calculate how much {chemicals} {be} {need} {in} {a} {chemical reaction} {if} {no} reactants chemicals that {be} reacted should {be} left
If too much reactant {be} used there {will} {be} some reactants {left} {in} {the} {chemical industry} reaction
{Acid}s {and} {base chemistry} {be} {Common year} chemicals
{Acid} release {List of H postal codes of Canada} {ion}s when {in} water {and} {base chemistry} release {Hydroxide} {ion} when {in} water
{Acid} can {Chemical reaction} with bases
The {List of H postal codes of Canada} {ion} {be} taken from {the} {acid} by {the} base
This makes water HO
A {sodium chloride} {be} also made when {a} {acid} {and} {a} {base} {Chemical reaction} together
An {example} would {be} {Chemical reaction} {hydrochloric acid} HCl {and} {sodium hydroxide} NaOH
{Hydrochloric acid} releases {List of H postal codes of Canada} {and} Cl {ion} {in} water
The {base} releases Na {and} {Hydroxide} ions
The {List of H postal codes of Canada} {and} {the} {Hydroxide} {Chemical reaction} {to} make water
There {be} {a} {solution} {of} {sodium chloride} NaCl left
Sodium chloride {be} {a} {salt}
{Chemistry} {be} very useful {in} everyday {life} {and} makes {up} {the} {Foundation engineering} {of} many {branch} {of} science
Most {Object grammar} {be} made by {chemist} people who do chemistry
Chemists {be} constantly working {to} find {new} {and} useful substances
Chemists make {new} {Medicine} {and} {material} {like} {paint}s that we use every day
{glasses} {a} lab {coat} {and} {glove}s
He {be} looking at {a} {Stone} from {the} {moon} Many {chemicals} {be} harmless but there {be} some {chemicals} that {be} dangerous
For example {mercuryII chloride} {be} very 
{Chromate}s can cause {cancer}
{TinII chloride} {pollute} {water} easily
{Hydrochloric acid} can cause bad burns
Some {chemicals} {like} {hydrogen} can explode or catch fire
To stay safe {chemist} {experiment} with {chemicals} {in} {a} {chemical industry} lab
They use special equipment {and} clothing {to} do {reaction} {and} keep {the} {chemicals} contained
The {chemicals} used {in} {Medicine} {and} {in} things {like} {bleach} have {be} {test} {to} make sure they {be} {safe} {if} used correctly

Creativity {be} {the} {ability} {of} {a} {person} or {group} {to} make something {new} {and} useful or valuable or {the} {process} {of} making something {new} {and} useful or valuable
It happens {in} all {area} {of} {life}  science art {literature} {and} music
{As} {a} personal {ability} it {be} very difficult {to} {measure}
The reason {be} that we dont {knowledge} {the} {Mental illness} {process} that {help} some {people} {be} more creative than others
Judging what {be} creative {be} also controversial
Some {people} say only things which {be} historically {new} {be} creative while other {people} say that {if} it {be} {new} for {the} creator {and} {the} {people} around them then it {be} also creativity
Some think {creativity} {be} {a} important thing that makes {human}s {different} from {ape}s
Others recognize that {even} apes other {primate}s other {mammal}s {and} some {bird} {adapt} {to} {survive} by being creative for {example}  {primate} using tools
{Liane Gabora} believes that all {culture} comes from creativity {not} {imitation}
Therefore these {people} say {human science} should focus on it pay special attention {to} it {Ethics} for {example} would focus on finding creative {solution}s {to} {ethical dilemma}s
{Politics} would focus on {the} {political virtues} that {need} some creativity
Imitation would {not} {be} {the} focus {of} {education}
{Linguistics} might {be} more {interest} {in} how {new} {word} {be} {create} by culture rather than {in} how existing {one} {be} used {in} {grammar}
{Intellectual interests} recognized {as} {intellectual rights} or {intellectual property} {in} {the} {law} {be} {a} way {to} {reward} {creativity} {in} law but they do {not} always {Employment} very well
A {goodness} {example} {be} {copyright} which {be} supposed {to} pay {author}s {and} {artist}s but {may} only pay {lawyer}s {to} make imitative {argument} {in} {court}
Creativity {be} {a} central {question} {in} {economics} where it {be} known {as} ingenuity the {ability} {to} come {up} with {new} ideas or {individual} {capital city}  {capacity} that {individual}s have that do {not} arise from {simple} {imitation} {of} what {be} known already
This {be} separate from {the} {instructional capital} that might try {to} {capture} some {of} that {in} {a} {patent} or {training} {system} that {help} {Ethnic groups in Afghanistan} do what {the} {individual} {leader} or  {of} {the} {system} can do
In {urban economics} there {be} {Time in Australia} ways {to} {measure} {creativity}  {the} {Bohemian Index} {and} {Gay Index} {be} two attempts {to} do this  {and} {predict} {the} {economic growth} {of} {city} {base} on creativity

An earlier 10thcentury Bulgarian heresy {Bogomilism} {and} also {Manichaeism} {start} some {of} these trends
They used {a} bible {in} {the} {language} {people} spoke
Many other {Christianity} used {a} {Bible} {in} {Latin language}
{Latin} {be} spoken only by {the} {priest}s
In 1145 open challenge {to} {Catholic} dominance began
In about 1165 {the} first {Cathar} said that {the} Church {be} full {of} ravening starving {wolves} {and} hypocrites {and} worshipping {the} wrong God {right} {in} front {of} {the} most powerful Catholics
In 1166 {the} {Council of Oxford} {in} {England} wiped {out} {the} {English language} Cathars
It {be} also suppressed {in} {Northern hemisphere} France
In 1167 {Cathar} {bishop}s met {to} discuss {organize} {a} counter Church  {in} {the} {South} {of} France {the} Languedoc {noble} protected it {and} many {noble} {woman} became Perfects
Parish clergy had low {morale} or confidence
The {Catholic Church} {be} {against} Catharism seeing it {as} {a} heresy
In {the} {South} {of} {France} there {be} tremendous {religious fervor} {and} {a} {economy} that {be} {start} {to} grow {and} {a} {social} {class biology} {of}  {merchant}s {and}  {peasant}s {be} {start} {to} grow
Peasants {ownership} their {own} {land}
Meanwhile {in} other {computer hardware} {of} {Europe} {peasant} {be} {Force physics} {to} give {up} their {land} {to} {noble}s {and} become {serf}s or {slave}s  {the} {system} {of} {feudalism}
There {be} {a} strong central {absolute monarchy} that did {not} exist {in} {the} {South} {of} France
The {burgher}s {and} {banker}s had more {power} {in} this looser system
{R I Moore} {be} {a} {historian} who believes that it {be} desire {to} crush this {system} {and} take over {the} {land} that drove {the} attack
However there {be} {reality} {cultural} {and} religious difference {to} cause problems  {Troubador}s who combined some {of} {the} traditions {of} {the} {Bard}s {of} {the} {Celt}s {and} {Jew}s {be} both part {of} {the} {multicultural} {society} {in} {the} {South} {of} {France}
Their {influence} {be} {not} appreciated by {local government} or {Ancient Rome} Church figures
The {12th century} {Roman Catholicism} {Monk}s {be} founding their {monastery} outside {the} towns {drawing} {the} best {people} there
The {Cathar} thus had {little} competition
The {Cathar} Perfects {the} socalled Good {man} or Good Women lived restrained lives {and} spread their {faith} {in} {town}  where {the} {Catholic} {in} {general} did {not} have their best agents
Also {Cathar} {preach} that only these Good {leader} had {to} follow {the} regimens their whole lives  lay {people} could repent only on their deathbeds
Many {20th century} {Christian sect}s have similar beliefs
The {Pope} {order} {a} crusade {against} {the} {Cathar} {in} southern France
He said any crusader who answered {the} call would {be} given {the} same {reward} {as} {a} crusader who {go} {to} {the} Holy Land
This {be} {a} {absolution} {of} all sin
In {the} {Launguedoc} on {the} {List of countries and dependencies by population} {of} {July} 1209 {a} {Force physics} {of} about 30000 {Crusader}s arrived at {the} {wall} {of} {Beziers} bearing {the} {crucifix} pattee {to} mislead {and} {create} ease among {the} Cathars {thought} they {be} friend {not} foe {and}  demanded that about 200 {Cathar} {be} surrendered
The {people} {of} {the} {town} who {be} mostly Catholic said that rather than turn over their {friend} {and} family we would rather {be} {flaying}
    A mistake by {the} defenders {of} {Beziers} let {thousand} {of} attackers in
Arnauld Amaury made {the} famous quote Kill them all {deity} knows his own  on being asked how {to} tell who {be} {Cathar} during {the} assault
Everyone {in} {the} {town} {be} killed some while taking refuge {in} {the} church
It {be} guessed that 20000 {be} killed many {of} whom {be} {Catholic} {and} {not} {Cathar} at all
The crusade became known {as} {the} Albigensian crusade {after} {the} {town} {of} {Albi}
It {be} {to} wipe {out} {the} {Cathar} almost entirely over {forty} or so years
The {Crusader} {want} {to} {go} home but {be} {order} by {the} {Pope} {to} continue until {the} whole {South} {of} {France} {be} {control} {and} all {Cathar} {be} dead
In 1210 they {attack} {the} fortress at {Minerv} {and} built the first great bonfire {of} heretics  beginning {the} practice {of} {Pyre} that would continue {in} {the} {Inquisition} {of} {the} {CounterReformation}
It {be} interesting {to} {note} that at {the} siege {of} Montsegur when {the} {fire} {be} lit {the} {Cathar} ran {down} {the} hill {and} threw themselves on {as} their {belief} {be} very strong
{Catharism} disappeared from {the} northern {Italian language} {cities} {after} {the} 1260s {pressure} by {the} Inquisition
The last known {Cathar} perfectus {in} {the} Languedoc {Guillaume Blibaste} {be} {kill} {in} 1321

Time {Cube} {be} {a} {website} {create} by {Gene Ray}
On that website Dr
Ray explains his Time Cube theory which describes {the} {planet} {Earth} {as} having {a} {cube} {symmetry} {and} {time} {as} rotating four corners
He also says that all {of} modern {physics} {be} wrong
{Scientist} reject these ideas saying that they make {no} {sense} {and} cannot {be} {test}ed
The Time {Cube} {website} {Chinese characters} {in} {a} {angry} {and} hateful voice
On his site Ray says that anyone who does {not} believe {in} Time {Cube} {be} stupid {and} evil
Some {of} {the} comments {be} {racism} {and} discriminatory especially {against} {black} {people} {and} {Judaism}
There {be} also many comments {against} {homosexuality} people
Many {people} find {the} site {to be} difficult {to} understand
Ray has spoken about Time {Cube} at two {University} {in} {the} {United States} MIT {and} {Georgia country} Tech
At MIT {a} professor tried {to} cancel {the} lecture before it took place
Ray believes this {be} {Proof mathematics} {of} {a} {conspiracy} {to} keep {information} about Time {Cube} hidden
The Census {of} Marine Life {be} {a} tenyear survey {of} {life} {in} {the} {ocean}s {start} {in} {2000}
Its {head} {be} {Ron ODor} {of} {Dalhousie University} {in} {Halifax Regional Municipality} Canada
It uses {information} from researchers all over {the} world
More than 70 {nation}s {be} involved {and} over {a} {billion} {United States dollar} {will} {be} spent on it
It {be} {a} major {Employment} {of} {marine ecology}
It {be} founded by {J Frederick Grassle}
It {be} trying {to} do what {the} {World Wide Fund for Nature} WWF {and} {National Geographic Society} did for {terrestrial ecoregion}s  say exactly what {be} alive on {the} planet
In this case {in} {the} seas

Civics {be} {the} {research} {of} {government}
It most often refers {to} {research} {government} {in} high {school} {to} prepare {to be} {a} {goodness} {citizen}
In college {civics} {be} usually called {political science}
Since {a} {city} has {the} most unsimple {government} problems {the} {word} for this {research} {be} {like} that for city
Theories {of} {civics} can {be} {group} as  
{Anarchist} 
{Capitalist} 
{Democrats} 
{Green Party} 
{Libertarian} 
{Republicans}    
{Justice}   A {crime} or misdemeanor or felony {be} {a} {act} done by {a} {person} which {be} {against} {the} {law}s {of} {a} {country} or region
A {person} who does this {be} called {a} criminal
The basic {idea} {of} what things {be} called crimes {be} that they {be} {thought} {to be} things that might cause {a} {problem} for another person
Things {like} {kill}ing another person {injury} another person or {steal}ing from another {person} {be} {crime} {in} most countries
Also it can {be} {a} {crime} {to} have or {sales} {contraband} such {as} {Gun control} or {illegal drug}s
When some criminals make {money} from crime they try {to} stop {the} {police} finding {out} where {the} {money} came from by {money laundering}
{man} {and} {boy} commit many more {crime} than {woman} {and} girls
There {be} {Time in Australia} {level} {of} crimes
In some {jurisdiction}s they are 
misdemeanor  {a} minor crime typically {punish} by {a} {fee} or less than 1 {year} {in} {jail} 
felony or high crime  {a} major crime typically {punish} by 1 {year} or longer {in} {prison}
Different {country} have {different} {idea} {of} what things {be} crimes {and} which {one} {be} {the} worst
Some things that {be} {crime} {in} {one} {country} {be} {not} {crime} {in} other countries
Many {country} get their {idea} {of} what things {be} {crime} from {religion}s or controversial {event} which cause {a} {law} {to be} quickly created
For example {a} {religion} might consider eating {a} particular {food} {to be} {a} crime
When {automobile}s became numerous they {kill} or hurt many {people} {in} {road accident}s so {new} {laws} {be} made for them
In many countries {if} {people} say they made or {write} {a} {book} {movie} {song} or {Web page} that they did {not} really make or write it {be} {a} {crime} {against} {copyright} laws
In many countries {help} {to} grow make move or {sales} {illegal drug}s {be} {a} crime
In most countries {police} try {to} stop {crime} {and} {to} find criminals
When {the} {police} find someone who they think might {be} {a} criminal they usually hold {the} {person} {in} {a} {jail}
Then usually {a} {court} or {a} {judge} decides {if} {the} {person} really did {a} crime
If {the} {court} or {judge} decides that {the} {person} really did it then {he} or she might have {to} pay {a} {fine} or {go} {to} {prison}
Sometimes {the} {judge} might decide that {the} criminal should {be} {execute}d killed
This {be} called {Capital punishment} or {the} {Death} Penalty
There {be} {country} {in} {the} {world} that {execute} criminals {and} {Ethnic groups in Afghanistan} that do not
In many countries two {condition} must exist for {a} {act} {to be} criminal 
{man} rea  occurs when {the} offence {be} committed with intent or {knowledge} or recklessness guilty mind 
Actus rea  {a} wrongful deed  Both must {be} present for {the} {act} {to be} considered {a} crime
{Maize} called {corn} {in} some countries {be} Zea mays {a} member {of} {the} {grass} {family biology} Poaceae
It {be} {a} {cereal} {grain} which {be} first grown by {people} {in} {Ancient history} {Central America}
It {be} {now} {the} {third} most important {cereal} {crop} {in} {the} world
However {little} {of} this maize {be} {Eating} directly by humans
Most {be} used {to} make {corn} {ethanol} {animal} feed {and} other maize products such {as} {corn starch} {and} {corn syrup}
{Maize} {be} {a} leafy {stalking} whose kernels have {seeds} inside
It {be} {a} {angiosperm} which means that its {seeds} {be} enclosed inside {a} {fruit} or shell
It {be} has {long} {be} {a} {staple food} by many {people} {in} {Mexico} {Central America} {and} {South America} {and} {computer hardware} {of} {Africa}
In {Europe} {and} {the} rest {of} {North America} maize {be} grown mostly for use {as} {animal} feed
In {Canada} {and} {the} {United States} maize {be} commonly referred {to} {as} corn
Centuries {of} {plant breeding} have {produce} larger plants {and} specialized varieties
Corn has become {a} important ingredient {in} {Americans} {food} through {the} use {of} {corn starch}
People have {long} {Eating} {sweet corn} {and} {popcorn} with {little} {Food processing} {and} other {kind} {after} {Food processing} into {flour} for making {cornbread} {tortilla}   There {be} five {species} {and} many {subspecies} {in} {the} {genus}
They {be} all {plants} similar {to} {the} cultivated maize with less developed cobs
The wild {one} {be} sometimes called {teosinte}s {and} they {be} all native {to} {Mesoamerica}
REDIRECT {Mechanistic paradigm}
A {coin} {be} normally {a} {round} piece {of} {metal} that {be} used {as} {currency} or money
Coins have {be} made for about 2600 years {the} first place {to} make {coin} {be} Lydia modern {Turkey}
These {coin} {be} made {of} {Precious metal}s {and} allowed {people} {to} {trade} with {a} {standard} {amount} {of} metal
Most {people} use {coin} {as} {currency}
They usually have lower {value} than {banknotes}
Most {be} made {in} {government} {Mint money}
Many {coin} have unique or complicated {decorations} {one} {side} often has {the} {picture} {of} {a} famous or important persons {head} on it
The {different} {decorations} on each {side} {of} {a} {coin} might {be} used {to} decide things {random}ly
This {be} called tossing {a} coin
A {person} can throw {the} {coin} into {the} {air} {and} catch it
You then look at which {side} {be} {face} up
If {the} {head} {be} {face} {up} it {be} called heads {if} {the} other {side} {be} {face} {up} it {be} called tails
Before tossing {the} {coin} someone has {to} decide what each {side} means
Tossing {a} {coin} can {be} {a} type {of} {gambling} which {be} {illegal} against {the} law {in} some {country}
Some {people} {see} {coin} {as} {a} {sign} {of} greed such {as} some {Communist}s {and} {Puritan}s who sometimes condemn overhoarding {of} coins {and} {ascetic}s who often keep {little} {in} {the} ways {of} {money} coins leading {a} poorlifestyle
Because {coin} have {be} made for {a} very {long} time some {people} collect {old} coins
They can {be} much cheaper than other {old} things especially {if} they {be} made {of} cheap {metal} {like} {copper}
Older {coin} normally cost more than {new} ones but rarity {matter} moresome {coin} from {the} {1920} cost vast sums while some {Ancient Rome} {coin} cost very little
{Computer}  {2012}   A {computer} {be} {a} {machine} mostly electronic that {be} able {to} accept {information} {as} input {process} that {information} using predefined {algorithm} {and} {information} structures {and} perform tasks {as} output  including {the} transformation {of} raw {information} into information then knowledge {and} finally insight about {the} {information} domain
Output also takes {the} {form} {of} {the} {performance} {of} {physical} tasks {as} {well} {as} {information} storage {information} transformation {and} {information} retrieval
{Computer} can also {form} {network} with other {computers} for {the} purposes {of} {information} interchange {and} leveraging {a} distributed {computer program} model for {parallel} processing
The primary use {of} {computers} {be} {to} solve {human} {problem}  including {mathematics} problems {Science} problems healthcare problems {business} problems {economics} problems {social} problems {the} {human} {need} {to} {create} {and} distribute {art} {and} computational artifacts {and} {to} provide {a} means {of} {communication} between humans between computerized devices {and} directly between {humans} {and} computers
Calculating {machine} {be} {old} {in} {the} {history of technology}
{Early Middle Ages} {example} {be} {the} {astrolabe} {and} {the} {abacus}
Today {a} {computer} {be} {a} {Computer programming} machine
The two {principal} characteristics {of} {a} {computer} are It responds {to} {a} specific {instruction set} {in} {a} welldefined manner {and} it can {execute} {a} prerecorded {list} {of} instructions a program
There {be} four main {Food processing} steps {in} {a} computer {input device} {computer memory} {output device} {and} processing
Modern {computers} {be} very {different} from early computers
They can do {billion} {of} calculations per second
Most {people} have used {a} {personal computer} {in} their home or at work
{Computer} do many {different} {job} where {Automaton} {be} useful
Some {example} {be} {control} {traffic light}s {vehicle} computers security systems {washing machine}s {and} {digital} televisions
A {computer} user can {control} it by {a} {user interface}
{Input device}s include {keyboard computer} {computer mouse} buttons {and} {touch screen}  Historians disagree on which early {machine} {be} computers
Many say {the} castle clock {a} {astronomical clock} {invent} by {AlJazari} {in} 1206 {be} {the} first known {Computer programming} {analog computer}
The {length} {of} {day} {and} {night} could {be} adjusted every {day} {in} {order} {to} {account} for {the} changing {length} {of} {day} {and} {night} throughout {the} year
{Ada Lovelace} {be} considered {to be} {the} first {programmer}
At {the} end {of} {the} {Middle Ages} {people} {in} {Europe} {thought} {list of mathematics topics} {and} {engineering} {be} more important
In 1623 {Wilhelm Schickard} made {a} mechanical calculator
Other {European people} made more {calculator} {after} him
They {be} {not} modern {computers} because they could only add subtract {and} multiply {you} could {not} change what they did {to} make them do something {like} {play} Tetris
Because {of} this we say they {be} {not} programmable
Now {engineer} use {computers} {to} {design} {and} plan
In 1801 {Joseph Marie Jacquard} used {punch card} {to} tell his {loom} what {kind} {of} {pattern} {to} weave
He could use {punch card} {to} tell {the} {loom} what {to} do {and} {he} could change {the} punch cards which means {he} could {computer program} {the} {loom} {to} weave {the} {pattern} {he} wanted
This means {the} {loom} {be} programmable
{Charles Babbage} {want} {to} make {a} similar {machine} that could calculate
He called it The Analytical Engine
Because Babbage did {not} have enough {money} {and} always changed his {design} when {he} had {a} better idea {he} never built his Analytical Engine
{As} {time} {go} on {computers} {be} used more
People get bored easily doing {the} same thing over {and} over
Imagine spending your {life} {writing} things {down} on index cards {store} them {and} then having {to} {go} find them again
The {United States} Census Bureau {in} 1890 had {hundred} {of} {people} doing just that
It {be} expensive {and} reports took {a} {long} time
Then {a} {engineer} {Employment} {out} how {to} make {machine} do {a} lot {of} {the} work
{Herman Hollerith} {invent} {a} tabulating {machine} that would automatically add {up} {information} that {the} Census bureau collected
The {Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation} which later became {IBM} made his machines
They {lease}d {the} {machine} instead {of} {sales} them
Makers {of} {machine} had {long} {help} their users {knowledge} {and} repair them {and} CTRs tech {support} {be} especially good
Because {of} {machine} {like} this {new} ways {of} {talk} {to} these {machine} {be} invented {and} {new} types {of} {machine} {be} invented {and} eventually {the} {computer} {as} we know it {be} born
In {the} first half {of} {the} {June 20} century {scientist}   
Citizendium  
The {Crust geology} {of} {a} piece {of} {bread} {be} {the} {edge} where it {be} harder {and} darker
Crust can also mean 
{Crust geology}  {the} outer {solid} {layer} {of} {a} {planet} such {as} {the} {Earth} but other {planet} also 
On {Earth} {the} {Crust geology} can {be} {Division mathematics} into  
{continental crust} on which {the} {land} {of} {the} {planet} {Earth} sits  
{oceanic crust} which {form} most {of} {the} {ocean} {floor}  
{Sienna} with its {town square} {and} magnificent {town hall}
A modern {suburb} can {be} {see} {in} {the} background 	 A {city} {be} {a} place where many {people} live together
A {city} has many {building}s {and} {street}s
It has {house} or apartments for many {people} {to} live shops where they {may} {buy} things places for {people} {to} {Employment} {and} {a} {government} {organisation} {to} run {the} city {and} {to} keep {law} {and}  {in} {the} city
People live {in} {cities} because it {be} easy for them {to} find {and} do {the} things they {want} there
A {city} usually has {a} city centre where {government} {and} {business} take place {and} places called {suburb}s where {people} live around {the} outside {of} {the} centre
{Tirana} {capital city} {of} {Albania} There {be} {no} {rule} that {be} used all over {the} {world} {to} decide why some places {be} called city {and} other places {be} called town
Some things that make {a} {city} are  
A {long} {history}
Although many {cities} today have only {be} around for {ten} or {hundred} {of} years there {be} {a} few which have {be} so for {thousand} {of} years
For example {Athens} {Greece} {be} founded {in} {1000} {BC} {and} {Rome} {Italy} has existed since {7th century} BC 
A large {population}
{City} can have {million} {of} {people} {living} {in} {and} around them
Among them {be} {Tokyo} {Japan} {and} {the} {Tokyo Metropolis} around it which includes {Yokohama} {and} {Chiba Chiba} 
A centre where {business} {and} {government} takes place
{2017 Westminster attack} case {be} often described {as} {the} {financial capital} such {as} {Frankfurt} {in} {Germany}
The {second} case {be} {true} for {different} {level} {of} government whether they {be} {local government} or part {of} {a} larger {region} for example {Atlanta} {Georgia state} or {a} entire {country} for example {Washington DC}
{City} which contain {the} {government} {of} {the} {region} it {be} {in} {be} called {capital city}
Almost every {country} has {List of national capitals} 
Special {power math} called {town privileges} which have {be} given by {the} {government} {of} {the} {country} or its ruler
This {be} done especially {in} {Europe} during {the} {Middle Ages} 
Having {a} {cathedral} or {a} {university}
This {rule} {be} found {in} {the} United Kingdom
The {small} cathedral cities {be} {St Davids} {and} {St Asaphs} which {be} both {in} {Wales} {and} {Ripon} {and} {Wells} which {be} {in} {England}
In {Americans} English {people} often call all places where many {people} live cities See below Size {of} cities      {Tokyo} {be} {the} {world} most populous metropolitan {area} The {size} {of} {cities} can {be} very different
This depends on {the} type {of} {city} that it is
{City} that {be} built {hundred} {of} {year} ago {and} which have {not} changed much {be} very much {small} than modern cities
There {be} two main reasons
One reason {be} that {old} {cities} often have {a} {city} wall {and} most {of} {the} {city} {be} inside it
Another important reason {be} that {the} {street} {in} {old} {cities} {be} often narrow
If {the} {city} got too big it {be} hard for {a} {cart} carrying {food} {to} get {to} {the} {market place}
People {in} {cities} {need} food {and} {the} {food} always has {to} come from outside {the} city
{City} that {be} on {a} {river} {like} {London} could {cell growth} much bigger than {cities} that {be} on {a} {mountain} {like} {Sienna} {in} {Italy} because {the} {river} made {a} {transport} route for carrying {food} {and} other {goods} {as} {well} {as} for {transport} people
{London} has {be} changing continually for {hundred} {of} years while Siena which {be} {a} very important {city} {in} {the} 1300s has changed very {little} {in} {7th century} years
Modern {cities} with modern {transport} {system} can {cell growth} very large because {the} {street} {be} {wide} enough for cars buses {and} trucks {and} there {be} often {railway} {line} {as} well
In {the} US {the} {word} {city} {be} often used for {town} that {be} {not} very big
When {the} first {European people} {go} {to} America they gave {the} {name} city {to} {new} places
They {hope} {the} places would {be} great {cities} {in} {the} future
For example Salt Lake {City} {be} {the} {name} given {to} {a} {village} {of} 148 people
When they {start} {building} {the} {town} they made {street} plans {and} called it Great Salt Lake {City} for {the} nearby Great Salt Lake
Now 150 {year} later it really {be} {a} big city
In modern {time} many {cities} have grown bigger {and} bigger
The whole {area} {be} often called {a} {metropolis} {and} can sometimes includes several {small} {Ancient history} {town} {and} villages

The rest {be} known {as} Greater London
Many other {cities} have grown {in} {the} same way
These giant {cities} can {be} exciting places {to} live {and} many {people} can find {goodness} {job} there but modern {cities} also have many problems
Many {people} cannot find {job} {in} {the} {cities} {and} have {to} get {money} by {beggar} or by {crime}
{Car}s factories {and} {garbage} {create} {a} lot {of} {pollution} that makes {people} sick

In {Europe} {in} {the} {Middle Ages} being {a} {city} {be} {a} special  granted by {nobility}
{City} that {fall} into this category usually had or {still} have {city} walls
The {people} who lived {in} {the} {city} {be} privileged over those who did not
{Medieval} {cities} that {still} have {wall} include {Carcassonne} {in} {France} {Tehran} {in} {Iran} {Toledo Spain} {in} {Spain} {and} {Canterbury} {in} {England}

In {the} past {cities} got that {name} {if} they had {a} {cathedral} or {a} university
Some {cathedral} cities for {example} St Davids {be} small {and} {people} do {not} normally think {of} them {as} cities
{City} that became {cities} because {of} their {university} generally {cell growth} because more {people} {Movement} there {to be} {education} at {the} {university} colleges

{Ethiopia} The {information} that follows applies mostly {to} {the} {history} practice {of} {the} Church {of} England
A {church} {be} {a} {building} that {be} constructed {to} allow {people} {to} meet {to} {worship} together
These {people} {be} usually {Christianity} or {influence} by Christianity
Some other religious {group} also call their religious {building} churches
Depending on {the} {number} {of} {people} that {be} {in} {a} community {the} {church} come {in} {different} sizes
Small {church} {be} called {chapel}s
The {church} {in} {a} particular geographical {area} {form} {a} {group} called {the} {diocese}
Each {diocese} has {a} {cathedral}
In most cases {the} {cathedral} {be} {a} very big church
{Cathedral} {be} {the} seat {of} {bishop}s
{Edinburgh} {Scotland} {Ohio} {Berlin} {Germany} {be} {a} {13th century} {church}    {the} largest {Romanesque architecture} {building} {still} {in} {existence}  {be} {one} {of} {the} main sights {in} {Paris France}  In {the} {Early Christianity} {people} had {to} {worship} {in} secret
{Christian} {worship} {be} {not} allowed {in} {the} {Roman empire} so {Christianity} had {to} meet {in} {a} {secret} place
Sometimes they met {in} peoples {house} or barns sometimes they met underground
{2017 Westminster attack} places that {be} built for {Christian} {worship} {be} {small} {chapel} that {be} {cut} into {a} {Stone} where {people} could {worship} without being discovered
After {the} {death} {of} {the} {Ancient Rome} {emperor of China} {Constantine I Rome} {in} {337} AD
{Christianity} {be} allowed {to} have {building} {to} {worship} in
These first {church} {be} built on {a} similar plan {to} {Ancient Rome} {basilica}s
This plan {be} later used for {the} {fine} {Gothic} {cathedral} {and} {church} that {be} built at {the} end {of} {the} {Middle Ages}
There {be} several {computer hardware} {in} {the} {architecture} {of} {a} church
Not all {church} {will} have all these parts  
The {nave} {be} {the} main part {of} {the} {church} where {the} congregation the {people} who come {to} worship sit
The aisles {be} {the} {side} {of} {the} {church} which {may} run along {the} {side} {of} {the} nave 
The transept {if} there {be} one {be} {a} {area} which {crucifix} {the} {nave} {near} {the} top {of} {the} church
This makes {the} {church} {shape} {like} {a} cross which {be} {a} {symbol} {of} {Jesus}{be} {death} on {a} {crucifix} 
The chancel {lead} {up} {to} {the} {altar} at {the} top {of} {the} church
The {altar} {be} {in} {the} sanctuary
The {word} {sanctuary} means sacred place
People {be} {not} allowed {to be} {arrest}ed {in} {the} sanctuary so they {be} safe
The {altar} {be} usually at {the} {east} end {of} {the} church
People {in} {the} {church} sit {face} {the} altar
We say that {the} {church} faces east 
Churches {will} also have {a} tower or {steeple} usually at {the} {west} end
If {the} {church} has {a} transept {the} tower {may} {be} above {the} centre {of} {the} transept
In {Roman Catholicism} {church} there {be} always {a} stoup bowl {of} {holy water} {near} {the} entrance {of} {the} church
This tradition comes from {the} {fact} that {Ancient Rome} {basilica}s had {a} fountain for {wash} {in} front {of} {the} entrance
The {font} {be} {a} bowl where {people} often babies {be} {baptism}
This {be} also {near} {the} entrance {of} {the} church
This {be} {a} {symbol} {of} {the} {fact} that it {be} welcoming {the} {people} into {the} {Christian} church
Traditionally {the} {nave} has {long} {bench}es for {the} congregation {to} sit on
These {be} called pews
Some {church} {may} {now} have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can {be} {Movement} about for {different} occasions
At {the} front {of} {the} {nave} {be} {the} pulpit where {the} {priest} {preach}es these {talk} {be} called {sermon}s
There {be} also {a} {lectern} like {a} large {music stand} from where {the} lessons the {Bible} readings {be} read
If there {be} aisles along {the} {side} {of} {the} {nave} there {will} {be} {column} which hold {up} {the} roof
In large {church} or {cathedral} there {may} {be} {a} row {of} {little} {arch} along {the} top {of} these pillars
This {be} called {the} triforium
Over {the} triforium {be} {the} clerestory which {be} {a} row {of} {window} high {up} {in} {the} {church} wall
The chancel {be} {the} most holy part {of} {the} church {and} this {be} why it {be} often separated from {the} {nave} by {a} screen which can {be} made {of} {wood} or stone or occasionally iron
The congregation can {see} through {the} screen
On {the} top {of} {the} screen there {may} {be} {a} cross
This {be} called {a} rood pronounce {like} rude screen
Priests used {to} climb {up} {a} staircase {to} {the} top {of} {the} rood screen {to} read {the} {epistle} {and} {the} {gospel}
Sometimes {people} sang from there
Inside {the} chancel {be} {the} {bench} where {the} {Choir music} sit
These {be} called {Choir music} stalls
They {be} on both sides
The two {side} {of} {the} {Choir music} sit {face} {one} another
The {Choir music} members who sit on {the} {left} north side {be} called cantoris the {side} where {the} {Cantor church} sits {and} those on {the} {right} south side {be} called decani the {side} where {the} {deacon} sits
In some large {church} or {cathedral} {the} seats for {the} {priest} tip up
The top {of} these seats when they {be} tipped up {be} called misericords from {the} {Latin} {word} for mercy
This {be} because {the} {priest} or {monk} {be} able {to} lean {against} them when they got tired {if} they had {to} stand {up} for {a} {long} time
Sometimes there {be} {hole} {in} {the} {wall} {of} {the} screen so that {the} congregation can {see} through
These {be} called squints
If there {be} {a} recess {in} {the} {wall} it {be} called {a} aumbry
It {be} {a} cupboard for {Eucharist} {wine} {and} {bread} that have {be} {Consecration} by {a} priest
The {altar} {may} {be} {right} at {the} {east} end {of} {the} church but {in} larger {church} or {cathedral} it {be} often much farther forward
In that case {the} very {east} end {be} called {a} apse
Sometimes it {be} {a} separate {chapel} called {the} Lady Chapel
The {design} {of} {church} changed {a} lot during {the} course {of} history
Often {church} {be} made bigger
When this happened there {may} {be} {a} {mixture} {of} architectural styles
These styles vary {a} lot {in} {different} countries
In {England} {church} there {be} several {different} {Period punctuation} {of} architecture  
The {Saxon architecture} period {7th century}{1050} {be} {a} {time} when {church} {be} very simple
The end {of} {the} {church} end {of} {the} sanctuary {be} often rounded
Hardly any {be} {left} {now} because they {be} mostly made {of} {wood} 
The {Norman architecture} period {1050}{1190} came from {the} style called {Romanesque architecture} which {be} popular {in} Europe
The {arch} had ornaments which {be} called mouldings
The tops {of} {the} {column} looked {like} {cushion}s so they {be} called cushion capitals
The {window} {be} narrow {and} {round} at {the} top 
{Early English architecture} or {Gothic architecture} {1190}{1280} {be} {not} {as} {solid} {and} heavy {as} {Norman architecture} architecture
Towers {be} elegant {and} tall {like} {the} tower {of} {Salisbury Cathedral} 
The {Decorated architecture} style {of} {architecture} {1280}{1360}was popular at {a} {time} when {the} {plague} Black Death {be} raging {and} {a} {third} {of} {the} {people} {in} {England} died
For that reason {not} so much {building} {be} done then
There {be} lots {of} {stone} {carving} {be} made {in} {church} at that time 
The {Perpendicular architecture} style {1360}{1540} {be} very grand
It had lots {of} {straight} upward {line} {and} {fan vaulting}
This can {be} {see} {in} {Westminster Abbey} {and} {Kings College Chapel Cambridge}
Many {church} that can {be} {see} {in} {England} {be} built {in} this period
In {the} 1600s {church} {be} built {in} {a} variety {of} styles
Often they {copy} some {of} {the} {old} styles
After {the} {Great Fire of London} many {new} {church} {be} built by {the} {architect} Sir {Christopher Wren}
They {be} built {in} {the} classical style
Churches continued {to be} built {in} later {centuries} {like} this but also {the} {Gothic} style continued {to be} used
Modern {church} often do {not} have {the} traditional crossshape
It {be} difficult for {the} congregation {to} {see} {and} hear what {be} happening {in} {the} chancel
Modern {church} bring {the} congregation {Choir music} {and} {priest} {in} closer touch
An {example} {be} {the} {round} {design} for {the} {Church of Christ the Cornerstone Milton Keynes} {in} {Milton Keynes}
Modern {church} {be} often {simple} but with {a} {warm} character than {the} {Gothic} churches
Many have {Beauty} {mosaic} {glass} windows
{Coventry Cathedral} {be} {a} famous {example} {of} {a} modern {church} building

{Wallonia} {be} {the} {name} {of} {the} southern half {of} Belgium just {north} {of} {France}
Here most {of} {the} people {the} Walloons speak {French language}
There {be} {a} {small} part {of} {Wallonia} next {to} {the} {border} with {Germany} where {the} {people} speak {German language} 
The {BrusselsCapital Region} where {the} {capital city} {of} {Brussels} {be} found {be} {in} {the} {middle} {of} {the} country but surrounded by {Flanders} {Enclave}
It used {to be} Dutchspeaking but today {French language} {be} mostly spoken with some Dutch
The {population} {be} about 60 Dutchspeaking 39 Frenchspeaking {and} 1 Germanspeaking the socalled Deutschbelgier
To look {after} all these groups {Belgium} has {a} complicated {system} {of} {government}

{Cheese} {be} {milk} made into {a} {solid} {form} that {be} edible
There {be} many types {of} cheese such {as} cheddar {Swiss cheese} {and} provolone
Many things affect {the} {form} {texture} {Colour} {and} {flavor} {of} {a} cheese
These include {the} {milk} {cow} or {goat} {if} {the} {milk} has {be} {Pasteurization} {the} {amount} {of} {butterfat} {bacteria} {and} {mold} {in} {the} cheese how {the} {cheese} {be} made how much {fat} {be} {in} {the} cheese {and} how {old} {the} {cheese} is
For some cheeses {the} {milk} {be} {curd}led by {addition} {acid}s such {as} {vinegar} or {lemon} juice
Most {cheese} {be} acidified by bacteria
This {bacteria} turns {milk} {sugar}s into {lactic acid}
{Rennet} {be} then used {to} finish {the} curdling
{Vegetarianism} alternatives {to} {rennet} can also {be} used
Most {of} these {be} made by {fermentation} {of} {a} {fungus} called Mucor miehei
Other alternatives use {species} {of} {the} {Cynara} {thistle} {family biology}
People have {be} making {cheese} since before {history} {be} {write} down
It {be} {not} known when {cheese} {be} first made
It {be} known that {cheese} {be} {Eating} by {the} {Sumerians} {in} about 4000 BC
{Cheese} {be} made using milk
The {milk} {of} {cow}s {goat}s {and} {sheep} {be} most popular
{Buffalo} {camel} {donkey} {and} {even} {hippopotamus} {milk} can also {be} used
{Cheese} makers usually {cook} {the} {milk} {in} large {pot}s
They add {salt} {and} {a} {substance} from {the} {stomach} {of} young {cow} called {rennet}
This curdles {the} {cheese} {and} makes it solid
Some makers do {not} add {rennet}
They curdle {the} {cheese} {in} other ways
{Cheese} made {in} {factory} {be} often curdled by using bacteria
Other {ingredients} {be} added {and} {the} {cheese} {be} usually {ageing} for {a} varied {length} {of} time
There {be} many {different} ways {to} classify cheeses
Some ways include 
How {long} {the} {cheese} {be} {ageing}  
The {texture} {of} {the} cheese
These include Hard Soft {and} Softer 
How {the} {cheese} {be} made 
What type {of} {milk} {be} used {to} make {the} cheese
This {be} mainly what {animal} {the} {milk} comes from such {as} cows sheep {and} goats
The {diet} {of} {the} {animal} can also affect {the} type {of} {cheese} made from its milk 
How much {fat} {be} {in} {the} {cheese} 
What {color} {the} {cheese} {be} common {color} {be} yellow {and} white  There {be} also manmade {food} that some {people} use instead {of} cheese
These {be} called {Cheese analogue}s

{orbit} A {comet} {be} {a} {sphere} {of} mostly {ice} that {Motion physics} around {in} {outer space}
Comets {be} often described {as} dirty snowballs
They {be} very {different} from {asteroid}s
The {orbital inclination}s {of} {comet} {be} usually high {and} {not} {near} {the} {ecliptic} where most {solar system} {Object grammar} {be} found
Most {of} them {be} longperiod {comet} {and} come from {the} {Kuiper belt}
That {be} very {far} away from {the} Sun but some {of} them also come {near} enough {to} {Earth} for us {to} {see} at 
They have {long} tails because {the} {Sun} {melt}s {the} ice
A {comet} {tail} does {not} trail behind it but {point} directly away from {the} Sun because it {be} blown by {the} {solar wind}
The hard centre {of} {the} {comet} {be} {the} {comet nucleus}
It {be} {one} {of} {the} {black} things lowest {albedo} {in} {the} solar system
When {light} shone on {the} {Cell nucleus} {of} {Halleys Comet} {the} {comet} reflected only 4 {of} {the} {light} {back} {to} us
{Periodic comets} visit {again} {and} again
Nonperiodic or singleapparition {comet} visit only once
Comets sometimes break up {as} {Comet Biela} did {in} {the} 19th century
{Comet ShoemakerLevy 9} broke up {and} {the} pieces hit {Jupiter planet} {in} {1994}
Some {comet} {orbit} go around together {in} groups
{Astronomer}s think these {comet} {be} broken pieces that used {to be} {one} object

{Ikeya seki}   In {old} times {people} used {to be} scared {of} comets
They did {not} know what they were or where they came from
Some {thought} that they {be} fireballs sent from demons or {deity} {to} destroy {the} earth
They said that each {time} {a} {comet} appeared it would bring bad luck with it
Whenever {a} {comet} appeared {a} {king} would die
For example {the} {Bayeux Tapestry} shows {the} return {of} {Halleys Comet} {and} {the} {death} {of} {a} king
Comets {be} also known {to} end {war} {and} {thought} {to} bring famine
During {the} {Renaissance} {astronomer}s {start} {to} look at {comet} with less superstition {and} {to} {base} their {science} on observations
{Tycho Brahe} reasoned that {comet} did {not} come from {the} earth {and} his calculations showed that {comet} must {be} six {time} farther than {the} {earth} {be} from {the} moon
{Edmond Halley} reasoned that some {comet} {be} periodic that is they appear {again} {after} {a} certain {number} {of} years {and} {again} {and} again
This led {to} {the} first prediction {of} {a} {comet} return {Halleys Comet} {name} {after} him
{Isaac Newton} also {research} comets
He realised that {comet} make Uturns around {the} sun
He asked his {friend} {Edmond Halley} {to} publish this {in} his {book} {Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica}
Before Newton said this {people} believed that {comet} {go} {in} {to} {the} sun then another comes {out} from behind {the} sun
In later {year} some {astronomer} {thought} {comet} {be} spit {out} by planets especially {Jupiter}
All this {new} {information} {and} {research} gave {people} confidence but some {still} {thought} that {comet} {be} messengers from {the} gods
One {18th century} {Sight} said that {comet} {be} {the} places that {hell} was where {soul} would ride being {burn} {up} by {the} {heat} {of} {the} {sun} {and} frozen by {the} {cold} {of} space
In modern {time} {space probe}s have visited {comet} {to} learn more about them

{Christianity} {be} {the} {world} largest religion with 21 {billion} followers around {the} world
{Christianity} consider {the} {Bible} {to be} {a} sacred book inspired by God
The {Bible} {be} {a} combination {of} {the} {Hebrew language} Bible or Torah {and} {a} collection {of} {writing} called {the} New Testament
Views on {the} importance {of} these {writing} vary
Some {Christian} {group} prefer {to} favor {the} New Testament while {Ethnic groups in Afghanistan} believe {the} entire {Bible} {be} equally important
Also while many {Christianity} prefer {to} consider {the} {Bible} {as} true inspired by God {not} all {group} believe that it {be} completely accurate
Some {of} these {group} {may} think that {the} {Bible} {be} {a} collection {of} {story} meant {to} show who {God} is or {even} just {the} {opinion} {of} {humans} that reveal some commonlybelieved truth
The issue {of} who {be} {a} Christian can {be} very controversial
{Christianity} often disagree over this issue due {to} their differences {in} {opinion} on {spiritual} matters
It {be} {not} possible {to} provide {a} {statement} that all readers {may} agree with therefore {a} {definition} {will} {not} {be} provided

{Calculus} {be} {a} {branch} {of} {mathematics} which {help} us {knowledge} changes between {value} that {be} related by {a} {Function mathematics}
For example {if} {you} had {one} formula telling how much {money} {you} got every day {calculus} would {help} {you} {knowledge} related formulas {like} how much {money} {you} have {in} total {and} whether {you} {be} getting more {money} or less than {you} used to
All these formulas {be} {function mathematics} {of} time {and} so that {be} {one} way {to} think {of} {calculus}  {research} {Function mathematics} {of} time
There {be} two {different} types {of} calculus
Differential {calculus} {Division mathematics} things into {small} different pieces {and} tells us how they change from {one} moment {to} {the} next while {integral} {calculus} {oxide} integrates {the} {small} pieces together {and} tells us how much {of} something {be} made overall by {a} {television programme} {of} changes
{Calculus} {be} used {in} many {different} {area} such {as} {physics} {astronomy} {biology} {engineering} {economics} {medicine} {and} {sociology}
In {the} 1670s {and} 1680s Sir {Isaac Newton} {in} {England} {and} {Gottfried Leibniz} {in} {Germany} figured {out} {calculus} at {the} same time working separately from each other
Newton {want} {to} have {a} {new} way {to} {predict} where {to} {see} {planet} {in} {the} sky because {astronomy} had always {be} {a} popular {and} useful {form} {of} science {and} knowing more about {the} {motion physics} {of} {the} {Object grammar} {in} {the} {night} {sky} {be} important for {navigation} {of} ships
{Gottfried Leibniz} {want} {to} {measure} {the} {Outer space} area {under} {a} {curve} a {line} which {be} {not} straight
Many {year} later {the} two {man} argued over who discovered it first
{Scientist} from {England} {support} Newton but {scientists} from {the} rest {of} {Europe} {support} Leibniz
Most {mathematician} today agree that both {man} share {the} {credit} equally
Some {computer hardware} {of} modern {calculus} come from Newton such {as} its uses {in} {physics}
Other {computer hardware} come from Leibniz such {as} {the} {symbol} used {to} {write} it
They {be} {not} {the} first {people} {to} use {mathematics} {to} describe {the} {physical} {world}  {Aristotle} {and} {Pythagoras} came earlier {and} so did {Galileo Galilei} who said that {mathematics} {be} {the} {language} {of} science
But both Newton {and} {Gottfried Leibniz} {be} {the} first {to} {design} {a} {system} that describes how things change over {time} {and} can {predict} how they {will} change {in} {the} future
The {name} calculus {be} {the} {Latin language} {word} for {a} {small} {stone} {the} {Ancient history} {Roman Empire} used {in} counting {and} {gambling}
The {English language} {word} calculate comes from {the} same {Latin} word
Differential {calculus} {be} {the} {process} {of} finding {out} {the} {rate mathematics} {of} change {of} {a} {variable} compared {to} another variable
It can {be} used {to} find {the} {speed} {of} {a} moving {Object grammar} or {the} {mathematics} {of} {a} curve figure {out} {the} maximum or minimum {point} {of} {a} curve or find answers {to} {problem} {in} {the} {electricity} {and} {magnetism} {area} {of} physics among many other uses
Many {amount} can {be} variables which can change their {value} unlike {number} such {as} 5 or 200
Some {example} {of} {variable} {be} {distance} {and} {time}
The {speed} {of} {a} {Object grammar} {be} how {far} it {travel} {in} {a} particular time
So {if} {a} {town} {be} 80 {kilometres} 50 miles away {and} {a} {person} {in} {a} {car} gets there {in} {one} hour they have traveled at {a} {average} {speed} {of} 80 {kilometres} 50 miles per hour
But this {be} only {a} {average}  they {may} have {be} traveling {speed} at some {time} on {a} highway {and} {slow} at {Ethnic groups in Afghanistan} at {a} {traffic light} or on {a} {small} {street} where {people} live
Imagine {a} {driver} trying {to} figure {out} {a} {car} {speed} using only its odometer distance meter {and} clock without {a} speedometer
Until {calculus} {be} invented {the} only way {to} {Employment} this {out} {be} {to} {cut} {the} {time} into {small} {and} {small} pieces so {the} {average} {speed} over {the} {small} {time} would get closer {and} closer {to} {the} actual {speed} at {a} {point} {in} time
This {be} {a} very {long} {and} hard {process} {and} had {to be} done each {time} {people} {want} {to} {Employment} something out
{Trigonometric function}s {to} {the} {curve}  A very similar {problem} {be} {to} find {the}  how steep it is at any {point} on {a} {curve}
The {mathematics} {of} {a} {straight} {line} {be} easy {to} {Employment} {out}  it {be} simply how much it {go} {up} y or  {Division mathematics} by how much it {go} {across} x or 
On {a} curve though {the} {mathematics} {be} {a} {variable} has {different} {value} at {different} points because {the} {line} bends
But {if} {the} {curve} {be} {to be} {cut} into very very {small} pieces {the} {curve} at {the} {point} would look almost {like} {a} very {short} {straight} line
So {to} {Employment} {out} its slope {a} {straight} {line} can {be} {draw} through {the} {point} with {the} same {mathematics} {as} {the} {curve} at that point
If it {be} done exactly right {the} {straight} {line} {will} have {the} same {mathematics} {as} {the} curve {and} {be} called {a} {Tangent geometry}
But there {be} {no} way {to} know without very complicated mathematics whether {the} {Trigonometric function} {be} exactly right {and} our {eye} {be} {not} accurate enough {to be} certain whether it {be} exact or simply very close
What Newton {and} {Gottfried Leibniz} found {be} {a} way {to} {Employment} {out} {the} {mathematics} or {the} {speed} {in} {the} {distance} example exactly using {simple} {and} logical rules
They {Division mathematics} {the} {curve} into {a} {infinity} {number} {of} very {small} pieces
They then chose {point} on either {side} {of} {the} range they {be} {interest} {in} {and} {Employment} {out} {Trigonometric function} at each
{As} {the} {point} {Movement} closer together towards {the} {point} they {be} {interest} in {the} {mathematics} approached {a} particular {value} {as} {the} {Trigonometric function} approached {the} {reality} {mathematics} {of} {the} curve
The particular {value} it approached {be} {the} actual slope
Lets say we have {a} {Function mathematics} y  fx f {be} {short} for {function mathematics} so this {equation} means y {be} {a} {Function mathematics} {of} x
This tells us that how high y {be} on {the} {vertical} axis depends on what x the {horizontal} axis {be} at that time
For example with {the} {equation} y  x we know that {if} x {be} 1 then y {will} {be} 1 {if} x {be} 3 then y {will} {be} 9 {if} x {be} 20 then y {will} {be} 400
The {Derivative mathematics} {produce} {Differential calculusHow it works} here {be} 2x or {February 2} multiplied by x
So we know without having {to} {draw} any {Trigonometric function} {line} that at any {point} on {the} {curve} fx  x {the} {Derivative mathematics} fprimex marked with {the} {Prime symbol} {will} {be} 2x at any point
This {process} {of} working {out} {a} {mathematics} using {limit} {be} called differentiation or finding {the} derivative
The way {to} {write} {the} {Derivative mathematics} {in} {mathematics} {be}   {Gottfried Leibniz} came {to} {the} same result but called h dx which means with respect {to} x
He called {the} resulting change {in} fx dy which means a tiny {amount} {of} y
{Gottfried Leibniz} notation {be} used by more {book} because it {be} easy {to} {knowledge} when {the} {algebraic equation} become more complicated
In {Gottfried Leibniz} notation   {Mathematicians} have grown this basic {theory} {to} make {simple} {algebra} {rule} which can {be} used {to} find {the} {Derivative mathematics} {of} almost any function
Integral {calculus} {be} {the} {process} {of} calculating {the} {area} underneath {a} {graph} {of} {a} function
An {example} {be} calculating {the} {distance} {a} {car} travels {if} {you} know {the} {speed} {of} {the} {car} at {different} {point} {in} {time} {and} {draw} {a} {graph} {of} this speed then {the} {distance} {the} {car} {travel} {will} {be} {the} {area} {under} {the} graph
The way {to} do this {be} {to} {Division mathematics} {the} {graph} into many very {small} pieces {and} then {draw} very thin rectangles {under} each piece
{As} {the} rectangles become thinner {and} thinner {the} rectangles {cover} {the} {area} underneath {the} {graph} better {and} better
The {area} {of} {a} rectangle {be} easy {to} calculate so we can calculate {the} total {area} {of} all {the} rectangles
For thinner rectangles this total {area} {value} approaches {the} {area} underneath {the} graph
The final {value} {of} {the} {area} {be} called {the} {integral} {of} {the} function
In mathematics {the} {integral} {of} {the} {Function mathematics} fx from {a} {to} b {Chinese characters} {as} 
The main {idea} {in} {calculus} {be} called {the} {fundamental theorem of calculus}
This main {idea} says that {the} two {calculus} processes differential {and} {integral} calculus {be} opposites
That is {a} {person} can use {differential calculus} {to} undo {a} {integral} {calculus} process
Also {a} {person} can use {integral} {calculus} {to} undo {a} {differential calculus} method
This {be} just {like} using {Division mathematics} {to} undo multiplication or {addition} {to} undo subtraction
In {a} single sentence {the} fundamental theorem runs something {like} this The {Derivative mathematics} {of} {the} {integral} {of} {a} {Function mathematics} f {be} {the} {Function mathematics} itself
{Calculus} {be} used {to} describe things that  {like} things {in} {nature}
It can {be} used for showing {and} {learning} all {of} these  
How {wave physics}s move
Waves {be} very important {in} {the} {natural} world
For example {sound} {and} {light} can {be} {thought} {of} {as} waves 
Where {heat} moves {like} {in} {a} house
This {be} useful for {architecture} building houses so that {the} {house} can {be} {as} cheap {to} {heat} {as} possible

AD
10th century
Home {of}  {Confucianism} {and} {Daoism} it had great {influence} on nearby {country} including Japan Korea {and} {Vietnam} {in} {the} {area} {of} {political} system philosophy religion art {writing} {and} literature
{Ancient China} {be} home {to} some {of} {the} {old} artwork {in} {the} world

Before {the} {Qin Dynasty} united China there {be} {hundred} {of} {small} {States of Australia} that fought each other for {hundred} {of} {year} {in} {a} {war} {to} {control} China
This {be} known {as} {the} {Warring States Period}
Although {the} continuing {war} made {people} suffer it {be} at this {time} when many great {philosophy} {be} born including {Confucianism} {and} {Daoism}
{Confucianism} {and} {Daoism} alone have {be} {the} {Foundation engineering} {of} many {social} {value} {see} {in} modern easternAsian {Culture} today
Its {geography} mostly looked {like} that {of} modern China except with northern {and} western {edge} that varied
It {be} often {attack} by northern {nomadic people} such {as} {the} {Turkic peoples} {and} {the} {Mongol}s led by {Genghis Khan} {and} {Kublai Khan}
During {the} {history} {of} {Ancient history} China {the} northern {nomadic people} {and} {the} {Chinese people} had {be} {fighting} each other {and} taking turns {to} {rule} {the} {land} {and} {the} {people} {of} China
However when {the} northern {people} beat {the} {Chinese people} {and} came {to} {rule} {the} kingdom they also {Municipal incorporation} {the} {Chinese language} way {of} {living} {and} became {like} {the} Chinese
Many {of} {the} strongest {dynasties} {of} {Ancient China} {be} {rule} by {the} northern people including {the} {Qing Dynasty} {Tang Dynasty} {Yuan Dynasty} Mongolian {and} {Qing Dynasty}
Each time they also brought {new} {Chemical element} into {the} {Chinese language} culture
While {Ancient China} achieved many things {in} {the} {First millennium} {and} early {2nd millennium} it became {a} {isolationism} {country} {in} {the} {15th century} This {be} because {Spain} found enormous {silver} {in} {the} {new} continent which {be} {the} main {currency} money {in} {Ancient China} {and} {Europe} at {the} time {and} {Ancient China} did {not} {want} {to be} bought by {the} foreigners
By {the} {time} {of} {the} {Renaissance} {European people} {power math} {start} {to} take over other {country} {in} Asia
While {Ancient China} {be} never actually taken over many {Europe}{a} {countries} such {as} {Britain} {and} {France} built {spheres of influence} {in} China
Since {Ancient China} had {cut} itself off from {the} {world} over {the} previous few {centuries} by {the} {Qing Dynasty} it had {fall} behind other {country} {in} {technology} {and} {be} helpless {to} stop this from happening
This had become {clear} when it lost {the} {Opium Wars} {to} {Britain} {in} {the} {19th century}
Still {influence} by Western sources {Ancient China} {face} internal strife
The Taiping Rebellion or Taiping War occurred {in} {Ancient China} from {1851} through 1864
The Taiping Rebellion {be} led by Hong Xiuquan from Guangdon
Hong Xiuquan {be} {influence} by {Christian} missionaries {and} {Declaration of Independence of Armenia 1918} himself {the} {brother} {of} Jesus
Hong made his mission {to} bring {down} {the} {Qing Dynasty} Dynasty
Gaining {influence} on {the} southern {Chinese language} population {the} Taiping Rebellion attracted {ten} {of} {thousand} {of} supporters
The Taiping {regime} successfully {create} {a} {state} within {the} {Qing Dynasty} {Empire} with {the} {capital city} at Nanjing
Hong called his {new} {state} {the} Taiping Tianguo or The Heavenly {State} {of} Great Peace
Local {army} eventually suppressed {the} rebellion at {the} final {battle} {of} Nanjing
In 1911 {the} {Republic of China} {be} founded by {Sun Yatsen} but its {government} {be} very weak
{Warlord}s {control} many areas
{Chiang Kaishek} led {war} {against} them {and} {he} became {President of Argentina} {and} dictator
In 1931 {Japan} invaded {Manchuria} {a} place {in} {the} northeastern part {of} China
On {July} 7 1937 {the} {Japanese language} {attack} {the} rest {of} {the} country {start} what {be} called {the} {Second SinoJapanese War}
The {war} later became part {of} {World War II}
The {war} {be} fought for eight {year} {and} {million} {of} {Chinese people} {be} killed
However {the} {Chinese Civil War} later {start} between {the} {Kuomintang} Nationalists {of} {the} {Republic of China} ROC {and} {the} {Communist} {of} {the} {Peoples Republic of China} PRC
The {Communist} {want} {to} make {Ancient China} {like} {the} {Soviet} Union whereas {the} other {side} {want} {to} keep {Ancient China} {in} its {current} {state} at {the} time
The {Communist} {be} led by {Mao Zedong} {Liu Shaoqi} {and} others
Later Liu lost {influence} with Mao {and} his {death} {to} this {day} remains unresolved
The {Communist} eventually won {the} war
The {Kuomintang} led by Chiang Kaishek fled {to} {the} {island} {of} {Taiwan} {and} set {up} their {new} {capital city} {in} Taipei
After {the} {Chinese language} Civil War {the} {Communist} {leader} {Mao Zedong} {Declaration of Independence of Armenia 1918} {a} {new} country {the} {Peoples Republic of China} PRC {in} {Beijing} on {October} 1 1949
Under Mao {the} {country} stayed {Poverty} while {Taiwan} became richer
His attempt at {industrialization} {and} collectivization with {the} {Great Leap Forward} led {to} {the} {death} {of} many {people} from {famine}
The {Cultural Revolution} caused great {social} upheaval
After 1976 {Ancient China} underwent {market economy} reforms {under} {Deng Xiaoping} {and} {experience} rapid {economic} growth
{Ancient China} {be} {now} {one} {of} {the} largest {economy} {in} {the} world relying mainly on exports
In recent history {Ancient China} has had {problem} with protests blocking {of} {information} on {the} {Internet} {and} {censorship} {of} news
{1989} {be} notable for {the} controversial Tian An {man} Massacre
{Ancient China} {be} {the} origin {of} Eastern {martial art}s called {Kungfu} or its first {name} Wushu
{Ancient China} {be} also {the} home {of} {the} wellrespected {Spa Monastery} {and} {Wudang Mountains}
Martial {art} {start} more for {the} purpose {of} {survival} defense {and} {war}fare than {art}
Over {time} some {art form}s have {branch} off while {Ethnic groups in Afghanistan} have retained their distinct {Chinese language} flavor
{Ancient China} has had renowned {artist}s including {Wong Fei Hung} Huang Fei Hung or Hwang Fei Hung {and} many others
{Art} has also coexisted with {a} variety {of} {paint}s including {the} more {standard} 18 colors
Legendary {and} controversial {Motion physics} {like} {Big Mak} {be} also praised {and} {talk} about within {the} {culture}
{Ancient China} has many traditional {festival}s such {as} {Spring} Festival Dragon Boat Festival Midautumn Festival {and} so on
The most important {be} {Chinese New Year}
People {in} {Ancient China} {will} have {holiday} {to} celebrate these festivals
{Spring} Festival {be} {the} {Chinese New Year}
Dragon Boat Festival {be} celebrated {to} commemorate {the} {death} {of} Qu Yuan {a} patriotic {poet} {of} {the} {State} {of} Chu during {the} {Warring States} period
He persuaded his {emperor of China} {not} {to} accept Qins diplomats offers several {time} but his {emperor of China} did {not} listen {to} him
He {be} very {sad} {and} ended {up} {jump} into {the} {river} {to} end his life
The {people} {love} him so much that they did {not} {want} {the} {fish} {to} eat his corpse
They made {and} threw {rice} dumplings into {the} river
They {hope} {the} {fish} eat these dumplings instead {of} {the} {poet} corpse
They also rowed dragon {boat} {in} {the} {river} {to} get rid {of} {the} fish
Such practices eating {rice} dumplings {and} holding dragon {boat} races become what {Chinese language} do {in} this {festival} nowadays
Held on {the} fifteenth {day} {of} {the} eighth {Moon} month MidAutumn Festival {be} {a} {festival} for families
Now when {the} {festival} sets in {people} would sit together {to} eat {natural satellite} cakes appreciate {the} bright {full moon} cakes appreciate {the} bright full moon celebrate {the} bumper harvest {and} enjoy {the} {family} {love} {and} happiness
To {the} {Chinese language} people {the} {full moon} symbolizes {family} reunion {as} does {the} moon cakes
 Hence {the} MidAutumn Festival {be} also called {the} Family Reunion Festival

Dutton Speedwords can {be} used {as} {a} {second language} for {international} communications
Dutton Speedwords {be} also {a} {shorthand} {writing system}  this means {you} can use it {to} {write} quickly
The method {be} made {up} by Reginald John Garfield Dutton 18861970 {in} 1922
It {be} first published {in} 1935
It {be} called International Symbolic Script
A {year} later it {be} called Speedwords
It {be} changed {in} {1946} {and} 1951
It has two uses {to be} {a} {language} {and} {to be} used for {writing} quickly
Dutton {hope} that this would mean more {people} would learn it because they could use it for two reasons
The {book} that Dutton {write} about Speedwords {be} {not} {Publishing} anymore
But Speedwords {be} {now} being used by more {people} because they find it {be} {goodness} for working {online}
For example it makes it {speed} {to} type {a} {email}
Another way {of} {writing} quickly {be} {Pitmans shorthand}
This uses special {symbol} instead {of} letters
Speedwords uses {Ancient Rome} letters
This makes it easier {to} learn
It also means it can {be} typed using {a} normal keyboard
Each {word} means only {one} thing
This means {you} do {not} {need} {to} use {different} {form} {of} {the} same word
The {word} used {in} Speedwords {be} {the} same {as} {the} {word} used {in} many other languages

One way {to} define {a} {dimension} {be} {to} look at {the} {degree of freedom} or {the} way {a} {Object grammar} can {Movement} {in} {a} specific space
There {be} {different} concepts or ways where {the} {term} {dimension} {be} used {and} there {be} also {different} definitions
There {be} {no} {definition} that can satisfy all concepts
In {a} {vector space} a {vector} {be} {a} opened ended line {a} {dimension} {be} {equal} {to} {the}  {cardinality} or {number} {of} {direction} {of} {vector} or lines
It {be} also {equal} {to} {the} {number} {of} {the} largest {group} {of} {straight} {line} {direction} {of} that space Normal {Object grammar} {in} everyday {life} {be} specified by three dimensions which {be} usually called {length} {width} {and} {depth}
{Mathematicians} call this concept {Euclidean space}
{Dimension} can {be} used {to} {measure} {position} too
The {distance} {to} {a} {position} from {a} {start}ing place can {be} {measure} {in} {the} length {width} {and} {height} {direction}s
These {distance} {be} {a} {measure} {of} {the} position
Sometimes {a} fourth {4D} dimension {time} {be} used {to} show {the} {position} {of} {a} {event} {in} {time} {and} {Space physics}
In modern {science} {people} use other dimensions
{Dimension} {like} {temperature} {and} {weight} can {be} used {to} show {the} {position} {of} something {in} less {simple} {Space physics}
{Scientist} {research} those {dimension} with {dimensional analysis}
{Mathematician}s also use dimensions
In mathematics {dimension} {be} more general
{Dimension} {in} {mathematics} might {not} {measure} things {in} {the} {world}
The {rule}s for doing {arithmetic} with {dimension} {in} {mathematics} might {be} {different} than usual {arithmetic} rules
{Vector}s {be} used {to} show {distance} {and} directions
{Vectors} {be} often used {in} {engineering} {and} {science} {and} sometimes {in}  {mathematics}
A {vector} {be} {a} {list} {of} {number}s
There {be} {one} {number} for each dimension
There {be} {arithmetic} {rule} for vectors
For example {if} Jane {want} {to} know {the} {position} {of} Sally Sally can give Jane {a} {vector} {to} show {the} position
If Jane {and} Sally {be} {in} {the} world there {be} three dimensions
Therefore Sally gives Jane {a} {list} {of} three {number} {to} show her position
The three {number} {in} {the} {vector} Sally gives Jane might be  Sallys {distance} {north} {of} Jane  Sallys {distance} {east} {of} Jane  Sallys {height} above Jane

Distance {be} how {far} {one} thing {be} from another thing
Distance {be} {a} {measure} {of} {the} {Outer space} between two things
It can {be} {measure} along any path
Thus someone who {go} around {in} {a} {circle} has traveled {a} {distance} {even} though his {position} has {not} changed
Distance {be} {different} from {displacement vector}
Displacement {be} {a} {vector} that {measure} {distance} with {a} {straight} {line} {and} {in} only {one} path

A {circle} {be} {a} {curve}d {line}
Each {point} on {the} {circle} {be} {the} same {distance} from {the} centre {of} {the} circle
{horn anatomy} {and} {a} {tail} In some {religion}s {the} {devil} {be} {a} bad {spirit} or {supernatural} being that tries {to} {create} {problem} for {people} {and} {distance} them from {God}
Some {people} also use {the} {word} the Devil or {Satan} for {the} most powerful devil
The {word} devil comes from {the} {Ancient Greece} {word} diabolos which means someone who tells lies {to} hurt you Diabolos {be} {translation} {to} {the} {English language} {word} {slander}er The {New Testament} uses diabolos {as} {a} title for {Satan} {and} so The Devil became another {name} for {Satan} {in} English
In {the} {Old Testament} there {be} {the} {serpent} {and} {the} shaitan who {may} {be} two {different} characters Shaitan {in} {Hebrew language} means adversary {a} enemy or opponent
Shaitan {be} also {the} {word} used for {the} {devil} {in} {the} {Koran} who often appears {as} {a} {animal} {and} tries {to} get {people} {to} do {the} wrong thing
In {Christianity} {the} Devil {be} originally {a} {angel} {in} {heaven} called Lucifer
But {he} {want} {to be} {the} ruler {of} {heaven} {and} so {he} revolted {against} God
After {a} hard {fight} {he} {be} defeated {and} thrown {out} {of} heaven
Some other {angel} who {help} him {be} also thrown out
After {the} Devil {be} thrown {out} {of} heaven {he} {start} doing bad things on {the} earth
He {want} {people} {to} {worship} him instead {of} God
Sometimes {he} tries {to} {trick} {people} by giving them {false} promises
The other {angel} who {be} thrown {out} {of} {heaven} became {evil} {spirit} called demons
They obey {the} Devil {and} {help} him do {evil} things
The {Book of Revelation} says that {God} {will} {punish} {the} Devil {and} his demons by throwing them into {a} Lake {of} {Fire} that {burn} {in} {Hell}
This {will} happen {in} {the} future
Artists {draw} {picture} {of} {the} Devil that show him {as} ugly {and} evil
But nobody knows what {he} {may} look like
Usually {he} {be} {a} {spirit} that nobody can see but {he} can make himself look {like} {a} {reality} {person} {in} {order} {to} {trick} people
Many modern depictions {of} {the} {devil} portray him {as} {a} {red} humanlike being with {Horn anatomy} {and} {a} {point} {tail} carrying {a} {red} {pitchfork}
Not all {religion} believe {in} {the} devil
For example {Buddhism} do {not} believe {in} {the} devil
Many {Satanism} believe {in} {the} {devil} or {Satan} only {as} {a} {metaphor} {not} {a} actual being or person
Diarrhea DIEuhREEuh also {spelling} diarrhoea happens when {the} {body} makes more watery {feces} than normal
Diarrhea can occur {in} {humans} {as} {well} {as} most other {mammal}   Diarrhea {be} {not} {a} {disease}
But it {may} {be} {a} {symptom} {of} {a} disease
The most {Common year} causes {of} {diarrhea} are 
{Virus}es {like} Norovirus the most {Common year} cause {of} {virus} {gastroenteritis}stomach fluin humans 
{Bacteria} {like} {Escherichia coli} or {Clostridium difficile} 
Some {Medication} especially {antibiotics} 
{Food poisoning} 
{Lactose intolerance} 
{Artificial sweetener}s {like} sorbitol {and} mannitol which {be} {in} many sugarfree {food} {product business} {like} sugarless gum 
Other {problem} with {the} {intestine}s {like} {Crohns disease} {and} irritable bowel syndrome   In {developing nation}s diarrheal {disease} {be} {the} {second} most {Common year} cause {of} {death} {in} {child} {under} {ageing} 5
Every {year} {in} {the} world {diarrhea} {kill} around 760000 {child} {under} {ageing} 5
Because {diarrhea} {be} watery it takes away {a} lot {of} {the} water
It also takes away {electrolyte}simportant {sodium chloride} that {the} {body} {need} {to} survive
Dehydration {be} extra dangerous for {small} {child} because they have less {water} {in} their {bodies} {to} begin with
This means they cannot lose {as} much {water} {as} adults before they {start} {to} have serious {health} problems
In developing countries {diarrhea} {be} usually caused by {a} {infection} {in} {the} {intestine}s
These {infection} can {be} caused by {bacteria} {virus}es or {Parasitism}
These {infection} spread easily {in} some {developing country} because {of} {the} following reasons  Some {oral rehydration therapy} {solution} have extra electrolytes {like} {potassium} {in} them also
Some {oral rehydration therapy} {solution} come {in} packets {and} just {need} {to be} {mixed} with clean water
Oral rehydration {solution} can also {be} made at home
If {the} {water} {in} {the} {area} {be} {not} safe it can {be} {Boiling} {to} make it safe
Boiling {the} {water} {will} {kill} any bacteria viruses or {parasitism} {in} {the} water
  Salt {and} {sugar} {be} then {mixed} into {the} water
Drinking this mixture {after} {the} {water} cools {will} rehydrate {the} child {if} {he} {drink} enough
Adding {a} {banana} or {orange juice} can add {potassium} {to} {the} mixture
{Breastfeeding} {will} also rehydrate {a} {child} with diarrhea

However these add {even} more {complexity} {and} {weight} {to} {the} vehicle so {be} more appropriate for {city driving} where {service station}s {be} always available {and} there {be} much {stop and go driving}
Because they do {not} require any change or {investment} {in} {Railway station} nor much {in} {vehicle design} dieselelectric {vehicle} {be} believed {to be} {the} most likely replacement for todays {internal combustion engine}

{skull} {be} often used {as} {a} {symbol} for deat {Death} {be} {the} end {of} {life} {in} {a} {organism}
All {Biology} {and} {living} activity {of} {the} {life form} stop including {the} {mind} {and} {the} {sensory system}s
The usual {Signs and symptoms} for {death} {be} that {the} {heart} stops beating {and} cannot {be} restarted
This can {be} caused by many things
All {life form} have {a} {limit} lifespan {and} all {life form} eventually die
Living things which have {death} {be} normally described {as} being dead
{Death} {of} {humans} {be} often investigated for {the} cause {in} case {of} {crime} such {as} {murder} {accident} or {disease} that {may} continue {to} {kill} other humans
About 150000 {people} {death} every {day} around {the} world
About two {third} {of} these {people} {death} because {of} {ageing}
In {Buddhism} {reincarnation} {be} believed {to} occur
Reincarnation {be} {a} {idea} taken from {Hinduism}
{Confucianism} advises respect for {parent} {and} {form} {of} {ancestor} {worship} {to} respect both {dead} {and} {living} ancestors
Every {ethical tradition} including {the} {medical} {view} {of} {the} {body} has some {ritual} surrounding death
Often these excuse {behaviour} that might {be} {hate} {if} they did {not} have {the} ritual
For instance {one} {may} say that {organ transplant} {be} {like} {cannibalism}
Very much {of} what happens at {a} {human} {death} {be} ritual
People who wish theirs {to be} dealt with {a} certain way {and} who wish {a} particular treatment {like} {cremation} {of} their body should decide {in} advance {and} set {up} {the} {necessary} payments {and} agreements
This makes it much easier for their {family} {after} they die since there {be} {no} longer {the} {ability} {to} clearly {communication} {the} wish
For {the} same reason saying goodbye {be} important
Most {of} {the}  {of} {death} seems {to} come for {love} {one} who did {not} have {a} {chance} {to} say goodbye
Maybe it {be} {to} relieve this {Stress medicine} that {ritual} {be} created {and} {to} bring together those that knew someone so that {the} personal {experience} {a} {person} can {no} longer {communication} for themselves can {be} exchanged by others
Some ritual such {as} seances claim {to} allow {people} {to} speak {to} {the} dead
This {be} {not} claimed {to be} very reliable both by {scientists} {and} {even} by those who do them very often
Aside from wills goodbyes organ donations {and} funerals there {be} important personal {experience} {to} decide {to} pass on or not when someone knows they {may} soon die
Palliative {health care} focuses on basic {decision} {people} make when they {be} very close {to} {the} end {of} their lives {and} it ensures someone {be} always available {to} {talk} {to} them
It {be} {a} replacement for heroic {medical} intervention that {may} keep them physically alive but with {no} {quality of life}
{Human} {psychology} must prepare for {death} {if} it {be} anything other than {a} {quick} surprise  {Elizabeth KublerRoss} {write} that there {be} several {stage} {in} {dying} {of} which denial {be} {the} first {and} acceptance {be} {the} last
Recording {one} {life} {be} often something {people} with acceptance {will} do {to} leave {a} {memoir} or {a} full {autobiography}  Because {event} leave {living memory} {and} {may} only {be} part {of} {oral tradition} there {be} projects {to} {record} everything that {people} remember about {World War I} {and} {the} {Shoah}
{2017 Westminster attack} {of} these {be} {to} {record} everything remembered about {the} {US Civil War}
This discipline has changed {history} since we have so many more {first person account}s {of} {the} times {and} made {social history} much more standard
There {be} other {term}s for death
Examples are to pass away to {go} {to} {a} better place to {buy} {the} farm generally used {in} {the} {military} to leave {the} earth big sleep {and} to {kick} {the} bucket
{the} {term} {go} {may} also {be} {a} {term} for describing death for example {if} {a} {person} has died they {be} also said {to be} gone {as} {in} {go} {to} {a} better place or {no} longer here
Old {ageing} {be} {not} {the} only thing that can end {a} persons life
People make other {people} die
This {be} called {kill}ing or {murder}
Two famous {murder} {be} {John Wilkes Booth} killing {Abraham Lincoln} {and} {James Earl Ray} killing {Martin Luther King Jr} People can also {death} by {Accident} resulting {in} terminal {Injury} {hypothermia} {starvation} {and} {dehydration}

{Ethics} {be} {the} part {of} {philosophy} that deals with {Goodness} {and} {evil}
{Ethics} tries {to} answer {question} like  
What actions {be} good
What actions {be} evil 
How can we tell {the} difference 
Are {goodness} {and} {evil} {the} same 
How should we make hard {decision} that might {help} or hurt other {people} 
How do our actions affect others
When discussing ethics {the} {philosophy} {be} generally separated into 
{thought} about {morality} 
{the} involvement {of} {science}  
{the} freedom {of} {people} {to} decide for themselves how {to} {act} within their {own} beliefs
Morality {be} what someone thinks or feels {be} {goodness} or bad
There {be} many {different} moralities but they share some things
For example most {people} think that {murder} killing somebody {be} wrongcompare {Exodus} 20
13 Some {Philosophy} have {hope} {to} find more things that {morality} share
They think that {ethics} should use {the} {scientific method} {to} {research}  things that {people} think {be} {goodness} or bad
Their {Employment} can {be} used {to} {test} {the} fairness {of} {a} situation such {as} how {people} should treat each other
An {example} {of} this {kind} {of} {thought} {be} {the} {categorical imperative}
Many {country} have {laws} {base} on this {idea} {of} fairness
Understanding {ethics} can {help} {people} decide what {to} do when they have choices
Many {Philosophy} think that doing anything or making any {choice} {be} {a} part {of} ethics
{Ethics} {be} part {of} other {field} {of} {research} {in} many ways
Here {be} some ways  
{Ethics} {be} part {of} {the} {research} {of} {religion}
In religion {people} often learn what {be} {goodness} or bad from what they believe about {God} or gods
Some important {idea} about what {be} {goodness} or bad have come from religion
See {Ten Commandments} 
Some {theory} {of} {economics} say {ethics} has {to} do with {money}
Money {be} {a} big part {of} most {people} lives
Thinking about {morality} can {be} important {in} economics
For example there {be} {a} saying about {ethics} taken from {the} {Bible} that the {love} {of} {money} {be} {the} {root} {of} all {kind} {of} {evil} 1 TimothyThe {philosophy} {of} {Marxism} also says that {a} few {people} using {money} {in} {the} wrong way can hurt many other people 
Government {policy} can {be} affected by what {politics} think {be} ethical
Politicians try {to} {create} {laws} that {help} everyone do what {be} right
Political debates happen when {the} {people} who make public {policy} do {not} agree about what {be} right 
In work {thought} about {ethics} can {help} with hard questions
Work can {be} {like} both {economics} {and} politics
Workers have {to} make {money} {and} follow laws
But {the} best way {to} do both {be} {not} always easy {to} know
The {research} {of} this {be} called {business ethics} 
People {like} {Medical doctor} {and} {nurse}s have {to} make  {choice} about how {to} {health care} for people
Sometimes {the} {person} being {health care} for their {family} or {the} {Medical doctor} do {not} agree what {be} best for them
Also {choice} have {to be} made {if} there {be} enough {resource}s {to} {help} all
The {research} {of} this {be} called {medical ethics}
Similar {Research} for specific {profession} include {bioethics} {and} {legal ethics} 
Discussing {ethics} can also {be} {a} way {to} stop {people} {fighting} or {start} {a} war
By {talk} about ethics {people} {hope} {to} get what they {want} without being violent
This {Employment} when all {people} agree that {peace} {be} very important
But {not} everyone agrees about what {be} {right} or wrong
So sometimes {anger} can make it hard {to} {talk} without fighting
Along with {aesthetics} {ethics} {form} part {of} {axiology} {the} {philosophy} {of} what {people} like
{Conflict of interest} 
{Utilitarianism} 
{The Republic} {a} {book} by {Plato} that says that {people} who have {power} should use {ethics} {to} make choices 
{The Prince} {a} {book} by {Niccol Machiavelli} that says that {people} who have {power} should {not} use {ethics} {to} make choices
E Prime it means {English language} Prime {be} {a} way {of} speaking {English language} without using {the} {verb} {to be} {in} any way be is am are was were been {and} being
Instead {a} E Prime speaker or {writer} uses {different} {verb} {like} to become to remain {and} to equal or they might choose {to} rearrange {the} {sentence} {to} show that {the} thing does {not} actually act
For example {in} E Prime {a} {writer} would change {the} {statement} Mistakes {be} made {to} Joe made mistakes
 This change {in} {word} reveals {a} actor Joe where {the} previous {form} concealed {the} actor
Users {of} E Prime would consider {the} changed {sentence} more accurate
D
David Bourland Jr first suggested E Prime {in} 1965
Bourland had {research} {the} discipline way {of} thinking {of} {General semantics}
The main {idea} {of} {General semantics} {be} that {people} can only know what they {Astronomy} {and} {experience} when they see hear touch taste smell think {and} feel {and} furthermore that what they {Astronomy} {and} {experience} can affect how they {Astronomy} {and} {experience} {in} {the} future
Because each {person} has {different} {experience} throughout their lives they interpret their {experience} differently
Students {of} {General semantics} {and} users {of} E Prime contend that {to} say This {cat} {be} soft {leaf} {out} many other attributes {and} implies that {the} outside object {of} {the} {cat} {be} {the} same as {the} inside {experience} {of} softness
Instead E Prime users say This {cat} feels soft TO ME {to} remind themselves {of} {the} following That their {experience} {of} softness involves both {the} outside object called cat {and} {the} eyes hands {brain} {and} {nervous system} {of} {the} observer  That someone else might {experience} {different} aspects {of} {the} cat  That they themselves might {experience} something {different} at {a} {different} {time} or {in} {different} circumstances The {cat} might scratch them or look or feel {wet} or matted with dirt
   Although {languages} {like} {Russian language} {Arabic language} {Turkish language} {and} {Cantonese language} do {not} always use {a} separate {verb} for to be they do have {the} {idea} {of} being
 For example {a} {English language} speaker might say This {apple} {be} red
 An {Arabic language} speaker might say This {apple} red
 Most {languages} can {be} used {to} express {the} {idea} {of} {a} {red} apple
An E Prime user chooses {to} say This {apple} looks {red} {to} me {to} remind themselves that seeing red involves both {the} {apple} {and} {the} {eye} {and} {brain} {of} {the} {person} looking at {the} apple
Many {teacher} {of} {English language} encourage {student} {to} use {verb} other than to be
 To them using more {Active volcano} {verb} makes {writing} {clear} {and} more interesting
These {teacher} {want} {to} improve their students {writing} {and} {may} {not} agree with {the} {idea} {of} {General semantics} or E Prime

{June 5} {be}  {now} {a} {holiday} {in} Denmark called Constitution Day
Over {the} {year} {Denmark} lost many {of} {the} {land} that it {control} {in} battle
{Denmark} biggest {war} defeat {be} {the} Second Schleswig War in 1864 when {the} duchies {of} Schleswig {and} Holstein {be} {invasion} by {the} {Kingdom} {Prussia} now {a} part {of} {Germany}
This {be} {a} big loss for {Denmark} and consequently it began {a} {policy} {of} {Neutrality international relations}ity {after} {the} loss {meaning} it would {no} longer take part {in} any {war} or {support} other countries
{Denmark} did {not} take part {in} {the} {First World War}

After {the} {Germany} {be} {capture} on {May} 9 1945 {the} {Soviet} {Army} occupied {the} {island} until {April} 6 1946
After {World} War Two {Denmark} became {a} member {of} {NATO} {and} {the} {European Union}

After {the} {election} {be} done several parties who {be} {in} {agreement} {will} {group} together {to} {form} {a} {coalition} {government} {and} {the} {leader} {of} {the} largest party becomes {the} prime minister
Here {be} {a} {short} summary {of} {the} biggest {political party} {in} Denmark from {left} {to} {right} on {the} {PoliticsLeftwing and rightwing political parties}  
RedGreen Alliance Danish Enhedslisten {a} {communism} party 
The {Alternative rock} Danish Alternativet {a} {Green politics} progressive party 
{Socialist state} Peoples Party Danish Socialistisk Folkeparti {a} {socialist} party 
{Social Democrats Denmark} Danish Socialdemokraterne {a} {leftwing} party which {be} {social democracy} slightly socialist 
{Venstre Denmark} {Liberal Party of Australia} {of} {Denmark} Danish {Venstre Denmark} meaning left {a} {liberal} party 
{Danish language} Social {Liberal Party of Australia} Danish Det Radikale Venstre {a} radical leftborderline {rightwing} {liberal} party 
Conservative Peoples Party Danish Det Konservative Folksparti {a} {conservatism} party 
Liberal Alliance Danish Liberal Alliance {a} {rightwing} {Liberalism} party 
{Danish language} Peoples Party Danish Dansk Folkeparti {a} {rightwing} {political party} who dislike {immigration} people from other {country} who come {to} live {in} Denmark
Denmark {like} {the} other {Nordic countries}
{be} {well} known for being {a} large {welfare} state
There {be} many {small} hills lakes creeks {forests} {and} farmland
{Denmark} shore {line} {cover} 7314km 4545mi
Nobody {in} {Denmark} lives more than 60km from {the} coast
The {long} {river} {in} {Denmark} {be} {the} {Guden}
The {weather} {in} {Denmark} {be} quite windy {and} rainy
In {the} {winter} it does {not} get very cold {in} most years there {be} only {a} few {week} {of} {snow}
Every {ten} {year} or so {the} {sea} around {the} {island} freezes over but {in} most winters it does not
The {climate} {and} {topography} {be} {not} {goodness} for {winter} sports
Most {summer}s {be} {not} very hot
People always {dress} {to be} ready for {rain} or wind
There {be} also very sunny times but nobody can know ahead {of} {time} when these {will} be
The best {time} {of} {the} {year} for outdoor activities {be} {the} {month} {of} {May} {and} {June} until midsummer
{Denmark} {be} {Division mathematics} into five {region} {Danish language} regioner or {region} for one
The {region} replaced {the} former {county} amter {in} {January} 2007
The {region} {be} {in} charge {of} {hospital} {and} {health} care
{Ecology} {be} {the} {science} that  {Research} {the} {biota} living things {the} {environment} {and} their interactions
It comes from {the} {Greek language} oikos  house logos  study
{Ecology} {be} {the} {research} {of} {ecosystem}s
Ecosystems describe {the} web or {network} {of} {relation} among {organism} at {different} {scale} {of} organization
Since {ecology} refers {to} any {form} {of} {biodiversity} ecologists {research} everything from tiny {bacteria} {in} {nutrient} {recycling} {to} {the} effects {of} {tropical} {rain forest}s on {the} {Earths atmosphere}
{Scientist} who {research} these interactions {be} called ecologists
{Terrestrial ecoregion} {and} {climate change} {research} {be} two {area} where ecologists {now} focus
There {be} many practical {Computer software} {of} {ecology} {in} {conservation} biology {wetland} management {natural resource} management {agriculture} {forestry} {fishing} {city} {planning} urban ecology {community health} {economics} {and} applied science
It provides {a} framework for understanding {and} {research} {human} {social} interaction
{Ecology} {start} many powerful {Philosophy} {and} {political} {movement music}  including {the} {conservation} movement wellness movement environmental movement {and} {ecology} movement we know today
When these {be} combined with {peace} {movement music} {and} {the} Six Principles they {be} called {green} movements
In general these put {ecosystem health} first on {a} {list} {of} {human} {moral} {and} {political} priorities {as} {the} way {to} achieve better {human} {health} {and} {social} harmony {and} better {economics}
People with these {belief} {be} called {political} ecologists
Some have {organisation} into {the} {Green Party} Parties but there {be} actually {political} ecologists {in} most {political} parties
They very often use {argument} from {ecology} {to} advance {policy} especially {forest} {policy} {and} {energy} {policy}
Also {ecology} means that it {be} {the} {branch} {of} {biology} dealing with {the} {relation} {and} interactions between {organism} {and} their environment including other organisms
Many ecologists also deal with {human} economics  
{Lynn Margulis} says that {economics} {Research} how {humans} make {a} living while {ecology} {Research} how every other {animal} makes {a} living 
{Mike Nickerson} says that economy {be} threefifths {of} ecology since {ecosystem} {create} {resource} {and} dispose {of} waste which {the} {economy} assumes {be} done for free
Ecological {economic}s {and} {human} {development} {theory} try {to} separate {the} {economic} {question} from others but it {be} difficult
Many {people} think {economics} {be} just part {of} {ecology} now {and} that {economics} that ignores it {be} wrong Natural {capital economics} {be} {a} {example} {of} {one} {theory} combining both
Sometimes {ecology} {be} compared {to} {anthropology}
{Anthropology} includes how our {bodies} {and} {mind} {be} affected by our environment while {ecology} includes how our {environment} {be} affected by our {bodies} {and} minds
There {be} {even} {a} type {of} {anthropology} called ecological anthropology which {Research} how {people} interact with {the} environment
Antoine de SaintExupery stated The {earth} {teach} us more about ourselves than all {the} books
Because it resists us
{Human} discovers himself when {he} {measure} himself {against} {the} obstacle
{Environmentalism}

Everything2 or E2 {be} {a} {website}
It lets {people} make {page} about many {different} things {and} some {people} use it {as} {a} {diary}
E2 users {create} {page} called nodes {and} add stuff {in} writeups
Only loggedin users can {create} writeups
Only {the} {person} who {create} {the} writeup or someone who {the} {website} {owner} called gods choose can edit {the} writeup
On {the} other hand on {Wikipedia} anyone can edit pages but on Everything2 only those who can edit {the} writeup can edit pages
Everything2 does {not} require {a}  {like} {Wikipedia} does
So it {be} possible {to} have more than {one} article writeups {under} {the} same title node each by {different} authors {and} presenting {different} {point} {of} view
     MeshID          D019142  Ebola {virus} {be} {a} very dangerous {virus}
It belongs {to} {the} Filoviridae {family} {and} {be} responsible for {a} severe {disease} characterized by {the} sudden onset {of} hemorrhagic {fever} accompanied by other nonspecific {Sign language} {and} symptoms
Hemorrhagic means that {the} victim {will} bleed {a} lot inside {and} outside their body
The {virus} {attack} almost every organ {and} {Tissue biology} {of} {the} {human body} resulting {in} multiorgan dysfunction
Out {of} every 10 {people} who get Ebola on {average} five {to} nine die
There {be} four {kind} {of} Ebola {virus} that can cause {the} disease
The {virus} {be} first found {in} {Sudan}
It {be} found {in} {Africa} with very few cases {in} {Europe} {and} {the} {United States}
The Ebola {virus} that makes {people} sick lives {in} {the} {blood} {and} other {liquids} {and} {wet} things {in} some {kind} {of} nonhuman {animals} without killing them
{Scientist} think {the} {animals} it lives {in} {be} mainly some {kind} {of} {monkey} or {fruit bat}s
When {people} {touch} {animals} that have {the} virus or {wet} things that came {out} {of} those animals they can get sick
Ebola cannot {be} caught through {the} air or by being {near} sick people
The {virus} can only {go} from {liquid} into {people} bodies
This means Ebola can {be} caught by {touch} {a} sick persons {blood} {saliva} {mucus} {semen} {diarrhea} {vomit} or other {fluid} that come {out} {of} {a} sick persons body
If {a} {person} does {not} {death} from {the} disease {he} can {still} give other {people} {the} {infection} by having {sex} for nearly another two {month} {after} they stop being sick
This {be} because {the} {virus} can {still} {be} {in} {the} mans {semen} {after} {a} {long} time
1
Once {the} {virus} enters {the} {human body} via mucosal surfaces abrasions or {injury} {in} {the} {skin} or by direct parental transmission it fuses with {the} {cell} {line} {the} respiratory tract eyes or {body} cavities
2
It invades {the} macrophages {and} dendritic immune {cell} {and} releases its {genetics} content
The {cell} {explosion} triggers {the} secretion {of} proinflammatory cytokines initiating {a} cytokine storm
The {genetics} {material} takes over {the} {cell} {machinery} {to} replicate itself {new} {copy} {of} {the} {virus} {be} {form} {and} released into {the} system
3
The {virus} then {go} on {to} {attack} spleen {Kidney} {and} {even} {the} brain
The {blood} {vessel} leak {blood} {and} {fluid} into {the} surrounding tissues
This atypical clotting {and} bleeding at {the} same {time} manifests externally {in} {the} {form} {of} rashes
4
The {virus} causes {the} shutdown {of} other vital {Organ anatomy} such {as} {liver} {and} {lung} too
In fact it {be} able {to} invade almost all {human} {cell} through {different} attachment mechanisms for each {cell} type except for lymphocytes
The very {cell} that {be} meant {to} {fight} {infection} {be} used {as} carriers {to} spread {infection} {to} other {body} {computer hardware}  5
It has {be} found that {the} ebolainfected {cell} do {not} undergo normal apoptosis but exhibit vacuolization {and} {Sign language} {of} necrosis
When {people} get Ebola {the} first {symptom}s look {like} some other diseases
People get {a} {fever} {and} feel very tired
Their {headache} {stomach} {joint} {and} {throat} might hurt
Sometimes {people} think they have other {disease} {like} {malaria} or {typhoid fever}
Later {people} get much sicker
They bleed both inside {and} outside their bodies
They have {blood} {in} their {diarrhea} {and} {vomit}
They bleed from their {nose}s {mouth}s {and} {genital}ssex organs
They get {Shock circulatory} low {blood pressure} {speed} pulse {heart} rate {and} low {circulatory system} {to} {the} body
Their {Organ anatomy} might stop working
Ebola also causes stiffness throughout {the} {body} which makes it hard for sick {people} {to} move
Five {to} nine {out} {of} every {ten} {people} who get sick with Ebola die
There {be} {no} cure for Ebola but {if} {people} get {health care} quickly from {Medical doctor} {and} {nurse}s at {a} {hospital} more {of} them live
People with Ebola {need} {a} lot {of} {fluid} {to} replace {fluid} lost from {diarrhea} {vomiting} {and} bleeding
The most important {health care} {be} giving them {water} with {a} very {small} {amount} {of} {sodium chloride} {and} {sugar} {in} it
This {be} called {oral rehydration therapy}
It {help} {to} replace their {fluid} {and} blood
It {be} also important {to} give {Medication} {in} case they get bad {blood pressure} {and} {blood} circulation
In {December} 2016 {a} {research} found {the} VSVEBOV vaccine {to be} very effective in {the} neighborhood {of} 70100 {against} {the} Ebola virus making it {the} first vaccine {against} {the} disease
Many Ebola vaccine candidates had {be} developed {in} {the} {decade} prior {to} 2014 but {as} {of} {October} 2014 none had yet {be} approved by {the} {United States} Food {and} Drug Administration FDA for use {in} humans
{World Community Grid} {be} {a} {computing} project that {be} seeking possible {drug} treatments
People donate {the} spare {time} on their {computers} {to} {the} project
An editor {be} {a} {person} who makes changes {to} {document}s
More specifically {the} {word} editor can  mean 
{a} {person} who edits texts {see} {copy editing} 
{a} {Wikipedia} user who makes changes also called edits {to} {page} articles 
{text editor} {a} {Computer software} {computer program} for editing {a} electronic text or {mass media} {document}

Ecological {yield} {be} {the} harvestable {growth} {of} {a} {ecosystem}
It {be} most commonly {measure} {in} {forestry}  {in} {fact} {sustainable forestry} {be} defined {as} that which does {not} harvest more {wood} {in} {a} {year} than has grown {in} that year within {a} given patch {of} forest
However {the} concept {be} also applicable {to} {water} {and} {soil} {and} any other aspect {of} {a} {ecosystem} which can {be} both harvested {and} renewed  {the} socalled {renewable resource}s
The {carrying capacity} {of} {a} {ecosystem} {be} reduced over {time} {if} more than {the} {amount} which {be} renewed refreshed or regrown or rebuilt
The {experience} {economy} {be} {the}  {service economy} that customers {experience} directly
In {moral purchasing} {Natural Capitalism} {and} other {theory} {of} how {consumer} make choices they {be} actually choosing {experience} or {comprehensive outcome}s {of} their choices

Since {the} {acronym} {be} first used {in} {write} form there {be} {different} ways it {be} said both fak {and} FAQ {be} commonly used
REDIRECT {Liberty}
A {dictionary} {be} {a} {book} which explains {the} {meaning} {of} {word}s or more precisely {lexeme}s
The {word} {be} arranged {in} {alphabetical order} so that they can {be} found quickly
The {word} dictionary comes from {the} {Latin} dictio saying
There {be} several types {of} dictionaries {dictionary} which explain {word} {and} how they {be} used {dictionary} which translate {word} from {one} {language} {to} another {dictionary} {of} {biography} which tell about famous people technical {dictionary} which explain {the} {meaning} {of} technical {word} or {word} connected {to} {a} particular {subject school} sometimes called {a} {thesaurus}
Some {of} these come close {to} being {a} {encyclopedia} but {a} {encyclopedia} gives {a} lot {of} extra {information} about things knowledge {and} does {not} explain {the} use {of} {the} language
An encyclopedic {dictionary} gives less {information} about {the} topic than {a} {reality} {encyclopedia} does but more than {a} {simple} dictionary
Dictionaries which explain what {word} mean {will} give {a} {clear} definition {of} {the} {word} eg
{hippopotamus}  {a} {hoof}ed {mammal} with thick {skin} large {mouth} {and} {short} {leg}s that lives {in} {river}s {and} {lake}s {of} {Africa}
   A big {dictionary} {will} also give more {information} about {the} word
It {will} explain how it {be} {pronunciation}
Usually {the} {International Phonetic Alphabet} {be} used for this
It {will} explain how {the} {word} {be} used
This {be} {not} {a} {problem} for {a} {word} {like} hippopotamus but {a} {word} {like} put has so many {different} {meaning} that {a} large {dictionary} {may} have {a} whole {page} or more {to} explain how it can {be} used
It {will} also explain {the} {Etymology} eg
{Ancient Greece} hippos {horse} {and} potamus river
A {dictionary} {may} also give {the} {form} {of} {the} {word} {in} {different} {grammatical tense} {plural} {form} {Et cetera}   There {be} also {dictionary} which translate {word} into foreign languages
Very often {one} {volume} one book {will} translate both ways for example half {the} {book} might {be} translating from {English language} {to} {Dutch language} {and} {the} other half from {Dutch people} {to} English
When using {a} {dictionary} {to} find {out} how {to} say something {in} another {language} {one} has {to be} careful {to} choose {the} {right} word
A {word} {like} right has two basic {meaning} {in} English 1 correct {and} 2 {the} {opposite} {of} left
Other {languages}  have {different} {word} for these {different} meanings but they have {homonym}s {of} their own
A {word} {like} put has many meanings
A {goodness} {dictionary} {will} have {a} large {list} {of} these {meaning} {to} {help} {people} find {the} {word} they want
In many languages for example {the} {word} put {will} {be} {different} according {to} whether something {be} being put onto something eg
{a} table or into something eg
{a} cupboard
Dictionaries {need} {to be} updated frequently because {of} {the} way {language} changes
New {word} {be} often brought into {a} {language} eg lots {of} {computer} terms or {word} change their {meaning} eg gay or cool
The most famous {English language} Dictionary {be} {the} {Oxford English Dictionary} or OED
{Word} {be} always being added {to} {the} OED
They {be} never taken {out} {even} {if} they {be} obsolete not used any more
The OED can {be} accessed {online} with {a} {subscription}
{Wikimedia} {the} same {group} that runs Wikipedia has {a} {online} {dictionary} that can {be} updated by anyone at any time
It {be} called {Wiktionary} {and} it exists {in} many {languages} just {like} Wikipedia

If someone {be} found {Guilt law} {of} {a} {crime} their {punishment} {may} {be} {to} pay {a} fine {a} certain {amount} {of} {money}
In many countries {fine} can {be} {order} by police {court} {judge}s {and} some {government} {officer}s
When agreeing {to} {a} {contract} with {a} business {a} customer {may} agree {to} certain rules

Financial {capital city} {be} {a} {form} {of} {capital economics}
It {be} things that have {value} but do {not} do anything by themselves
They {be} only {valuable} because {people} {value} want them
For example {money} {be} {a} {form} {of} {finance} capital
You cannot do anything with {money} but it {still} has value

Some things {be} treated {as} {finance} capital {even} though they do have {a} use
For example some {people} {buy} {and} {sales} {land} but {be} {not} {interest} {in} doing anything with it
Some {people} think this {sort} {of} {trade} {be} bad because {the} {land} should {be} used {and} {not} just treated {like} money
Other types {of} capital such {as} {social capital} {and} {human capital} {be} rarely treated {like} {finance} capital
This {may} {be} because they involve people

Centuries ago many {country} used beheading {as} {a} execution for important people including England
In England many noblemen {and} {even} some {king} {and} {queen} have {be} beheaded
There {the} prisoner would {be} led {up} {the} scaffold {and} usually say {a} speech
Then heshe would {be} blindfolded {and} put hisher {neck} onto {a} block
Then {the} executioner would {lift} {up} his {axe} {and} swing it {down} onto {the} victims neck
If {the} executioner {be} skilled {and} {the} {axe} {be} sharp then {the} {axe} would usually {cut} through {the} {bone} {and} {Organ anatomy} {of} {the} victim {in} {one} stroke
But {if} {the} executioner {be} inexperienced then it {may} take many strokes before {the} {head} would {be} {cut} off
{Edouard Manet}
It shows {a} {fire} squad Many {country} do {not} allow executions {as} {punishment} any more because it {be} too violent
However many {States of Australia} {of} {the} {United States} {and} some other foreign {country} allow it
Even {in} {the} United States less violent ways {of} execution have had {to be} used
Here {be} some other ways {of} execution other than {hanging}  
{Lethal injection}  Killing {a} {person} by placing several {poison} {in} their blood
This {be} used {as} {the} {choice} {of} execution {in} most {US state} that allow executions

This method has {be} popular amongst {the} {army} around {the} world since {Gun control} {and} bullets {be} readily available
{Fire} squad {be} {the} lawful means {of} execution {in} {Finland} until 1944 when {death penalty} {be} abolished stopped by {the} law
In most cases {not} all {the} {people} {fire} have {reality} bullets

Some {restaurant}s also have large {deep fryer}s {to} fry {a} lot {of} {food} at once
Fecund {universe} {be} {a} {multiverse} {theory} {of} {Lee Smolin}
It relies on {models of our universe} {and} {statistics} from {astrophysics} but {be} more correctly {a} {theory} {of} {cosmology}
In this theory collapsing stars or {black hole}s {be} always {creating} {new} {universe} with slightly {different} {laws of physics}
Because these {laws} {be} only slightly different each {be} assumed {to be} {like} {a} {mutation} {of} {the} original universe {as} {if} each {universe} {be} {a} {kind} {of} {singlecelled organism}
It would {reproduce} by splitting {in} some sense
This {theory} relies on many {models of our universe} {to} model these mutated alternative universes {the} {one} that Smolin supposes {be} generated or spun off by {black hole}s
No {human} can ever {be} part {of} any {of} these other universes
Observations from {astrophysics} can only say {if} {the} {black hole} exist or {be} common {and} give some {idea} {of} how much {the} {laws of physics} can vary {and} {still} let {the} {new} {universe} {produce} {new} {black} holes
Smolin {predict} that there would {be} many {black hole} {in} {the} {universe} {humans} can see since they {be} likely {in} {a} very late born universe by {simple} probability
If there {be} many {black} holes that {be} {evidence} for his theory   {As} this shows {cosmology} has {a} very {different} {standard of evidence} {and} {burden of proof} than {be} required for {models of our universe} only which {humans} using mathematics can {Astronomy} {and} exchange {knowledge} on
It {be} hard {to} separate {science} from {religion} on such questions
It {may} {be} {a} {simple} {matter} {of} preference whether {one} {want} {to} {see} {one} {universe} {as} part {of} {a} {system} {like} {biology} or {like} {mechanics}  {clockwork}
Smolins {theory} {be} important mostly because it challenges {the} {mechanistic paradigm}
Even {if} it {be} wrong it raises {the} {idea} that {living} beings might have {to} {see} their {universe} {as} also {living} {to be} able {to} {knowledge} or {health care} about it at all
Some compare Smolins {theory} {to} {Gaia philosophy} which combines {biology} {geology} {and} {ecology} {to} explain {the} {Earth} our planet {as} {a} {living} thing
If both {be} right {humans} {be} on {a} {living} {planet} {in} {a} {living} universe
This {idea} {be} very appealing  which does {not} mean it {be} really right
{plant}s that {be} {Eating} {meat}   Food {be} what {people} {and} {animal}s eat {to} survive

After {World War II} {Egypt} {be} {still} {rule} by {a} king {Farouk of Egypt} 11 {February} {1920}  18 {March} 1965
He {be} {the} last ruler {of} {the} {Muhammad Ali Pasha} {dynasty}
Farouk {be} overthrown on 23 {July} {1952} by {a} {military} {coup}
The {coup} {be} led by {Muhammad} Naguib {and} {Gamal Abdel Nasser}
From then on {Egypt} had {military} rulers or rulers who had {the} {back} {of} {the} {army} {and} many citizens
Nasser became President from {1956 Summer Olympics} {to} 1970
Later rulers {be} {Anwar Sadat} {and} {Hosni Mubarak}
In {January} 2011 {thousand} {of} {protest}ers gathered {in} {Cairo}
They {want} {Hosni Mubarak} {to} leave office
He had {be} {the} {President} for almost 30 years
On {February} 11 2011 {Vice President} {Omar Suleiman} made {a} announcement
He said that Mubarak agreed {to} leave office
In 2012 {Egypt} had {a} {democracy} {election} for {the} post {of} President
The winner {be} {the} {Muslim Brotherhood} candidate {Mohamed Morsi}
The {event} which followed {be} {still} controversial but {one} aspect stands out
Morsi issued {a} declaration that {in} effect gave him unlimited powers
He had {the} {power} {to} legislate make laws without legal overview by {the} courts
This caused widespread protests
On 3 {July} 2013 {he} {be} unseated by {a} {military} {coup} {council} a {coup dtat}
After {a} {election} {in} {June} 2014 {Abdel Fattah elSisi} became {President of Argentina} {of} Egypt
Islamist movements such {as} {the} {Islam} Brotherhood rejected {the} change {of} {regime} {as} {a} {military} coup {and} {not} democratic
Today {the} {people} {of} {Egypt} {be} mostly {Sunni Muslims}
There {be} many {Christianity} {in} {Egypt} today
Many {of} these belong {to} {the} {Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria}
The official {language} {in} {Egypt} {be} {Arabic language}
The majority speak {Egyptian Arabic} but many speak other dialects
Some {Ancient Egypt} {still} speak {Coptic language}
{English as a second language}
They also speak {French language} {and} {Germany} {in} Egypt
These {be} taught {in} {Egypt} {as} additional languages
Many famous {people} {be} from Egypt
Some {of} these include {Omar Sharif} who {be} {a} {international} actor {Boutros BoutrosGhali} who {be} {the} first {person} from {Africa} {to} {lead} {the} {United Nations} {and} four {Nobel Prize} winners {Anwar Sadat} who won {the} {Nobel Peace Prize} {in} 1978 {Naguib Mahfouz} who won {the} {Nobel Prize in Literature} {in} 1988 {Ahmed Zewail} who won {the} {Nobel Prize in Chemistry} {in} 1999 {and} {Mohamed ElBaradei} who won {the} {Nobel Peace Prize} {in} 2005
{Mohamed Salah} {be} {a} famous footballer who {Play theatre} for {Liverpool} {in} England
A famous Egyptian {singer} {be} called Amr Diab
{Egypt} {be} {Division mathematics} into {April 27} {governorates}
The {governorates} {be} {Division mathematics} into regions
The {region} have {town} {and} villages
Each governorate has {a} capital
Sometimes {capital city} has {the} same {name} {as} {the} governorate
The {word} {goodness} can {be} {a} {adjective} that means something that {be} {want}ed
Something that {be} {goodness} {be} {not} 
See  {in} {the} dictionary
Good can also mean 
Good {and} {Evil} {a} concept {in} {ethics} {religion} {and} {philosophy} 
{Good economics} something that {be} useful
{Good philosophy} something that {be} important or valuable
                epoch  {Julian calendar}20000  {Earth} {be} {the} {planet} we live on
It {be} {the} {third} {planet} from {the} {sun}
It {be} {the} only {planet} known {to} have {life} on it
Lots {of} {scientists} think {the} {earth} {Age of the Earth}
It {be} {one} {of} four {terrestrial planet} on {the} inside {of} {the} {Solar System}
The other three {be} {Mercury planet} {Venus} {and} {Mars planet}
The large {mass} {of} {the} {sun} makes {Earth} {orbit} just {as} {the} {mass} {of} {Earth} makes {the} {moon} {Movement} around it
{Earth} also turns around {in} space so that {different} {computer hardware} {face} {the} {sun} at {different} times
{Earth} {go} around {the} {sun} once one {year} for every 365 {time} it turns around one {day}
{Earth} {be} {the} only {planet} {in} our {solar system} that has {a} large {amount} {of} {liquid} {water}
About 74{percent} {of} {the} {surface} {of} {Earth} {be} {cover} by {liquid} or frozen water
Because {of} this {people} sometimes call it  blue planet
Because {of} its water {Earth} {be} home {to} {million} {of} {species} {of} {plant}s {and} {animal}s
The things that live on {Earth} have changed its {surface} greatly
For example early {cyanobacteria} changed {the} {Atmosphere of EarthHistory of Earths atmosphere} {and} gave it {oxygen}
The {living} part {of} {Earth} {surface} {be} called {the} {biosphere}
{axial tilt} {in} {relation} {to} its {orbit} around {the} {Sun} {Earth} {be} part {of} {the} eight {planet}s {and} many {thousand} {of} {small} {bodies} that {Movement} around {the} {Sun} {as} its {solar system}
The {Solar System} {be} moving through {the} {Orion Arm} {of} {the} {Milky Way} {galaxy} now {and} {will} {be} for about {the} next 10000 years
{Earth} {be} about  away from {the} {sun} this {distance} {be} called {a} {Astronomical Unit}
{Earth} {Motion physics} on its {orbit} at {a} {average} {speed} {of} about  {a} second
{Earth} turns all {the} way around about 365 {time} {in} {the} {time} it takes for {Earth} {to} {go} all {the} way around {the} {sun}
To make {up} this extra {bit} {of} {a} {day} every year {a} {leap day} {be} used every four years
This {be} {name} {a} {leap year}
The {Moon} {go} around {Earth} at {a} {average} {distance} {of} 
It {be} {lock} {to} Earth so that it always has {the} same half {face} Earth {the} other half {be} called {the} dark {side} {of} {the} moon
It takes about 27 {day} for {the Moon} {to} {go} all {the} way around Earth but because {Earth} {be} moving around {the} {Sun} at {the} same time it takes about 29 {day} for {the Moon} {to} {go} from {dark} {to} bright {to} {dark} again
This {be} where {the} {word} {month} came from {even} though most {month} {now} have 30 or 31 days
{Age of the Earth} {and} {the} other {planet}s {form} about 46 {billion} {year} ago
They {be} made {of} {the} leftover {gas} from {the} {nebula} that {Formation and evolution of the Solar System}
The {Moon} {may} have {be} {form} {after} {a} collision between {the} early {Earth} {and} {a} {small} {planet} sometimes called Theia
{Scientist} believe that {computer hardware} {of} both {planet} broke off  becoming by {gravity} {the} Moon
{Earth} {water} came from {different} places
{Condensation} {water vapour} {and} {comet}s {and} {asteroid}s hitting Earth made {the} {ocean}s
Within {a} {billion} {year} that {be} at about 36 {billion} {year} ago {the} first {life} {evolution} {in} {the} {Archaean} {era}
Some {bacteria} developed {photosynthesis} which lets {plants} make {food} from {the} {Sun}{be} {light} {and} {water}
This released {a} lot {of} {oxygen} which {be} first taken {up} by {iron} {in} {solution}
Eventually {free} {oxygen} got into {the} {atmosphere} or air making {Earth} {surface}  for {aerobic} {life} see {Great Oxygenation Event}
This {oxygen} also {form} {the} {ozone}  which protects {Earth} {surface} from bad {ultraviolet} {radiation} from {the} {Sun}
Complex {life} on {the} {surface} {of} {the} {land} did {not} exist before {the} {ozone} layer
{Earth} {be} very {different} {in} {the} distant past
Long ago almost all {land} {be} {in} {one} place
This {be} called {a} {continent}
The earliest known {continent} {be} called {Vaalbara}
Much later there {be} {a} {time} the {Cryogenian} when {Earth} {be} almost entirely {cover} by thick {ice} sheets {glacier}s
This {be} called {the} {Snowball Earth} {theory}
The {Earths crust}  {be} largely {oxygen} 47{percent}
Oxygen {be} normally {a} {gas} but it can {oxide} with other {chemicals} {to} make {chemical compound} {like} {water} {and} rocks
9922{percent} {of} {Stone} have {oxygen} {in} them
The most {Common year} {oxygen}having {Stone} {be} {silica} made with {silicon} {alumina} made with {aluminum} {rust} made with {iron} {lime chemical} made with {calcium} {magnesia} made with {magnesium} {potash} made with {potassium} {and} {sodium} oxide {and} there {be} {Ethnic groups in Afghanistan} {as} well
{Earth} {shape} {be} {a} {spheroid} {not} quite {a} {sphere} because it {be} slightly {oblate} on {the} top {and} bottom
The {shape} {be} called {a} {oblate spheroid}
{As} {Earth} spins around itself {the} {centrifugal force} {Force physics} {the} {equator} {out} {a} {little} {and} pulls {the} {geographical pole} {in} {a} little
The equator around {the} {middle} {of} {Earth} surface {be} about  long
The highest {mountain} above {sea level}mdashthe wellknown {Mount Everest} which {be}  {elevation}mdashis {not} actually {the} {one} that {be} {the} {far} away from {the} center {of} {the} Earth
Instead {the} sleeping {volcano} {Mount Chimborazo} {in} {Ecuador} is it {be} only  {elevation} but it {be} almost at {the} {equator}
Because {of} this {Mount Chimborazo} {be}  from {the} center {of} {the} Earth while {Mount Everest} {be}  closer {to} it
Similarly {the} lowest {point} {depth} that we {be} {conscious} {of} {be} {the} {Challenger Deep} {in} {the} {Mariana Trench} {in} {the} {Pacific Ocean}
It {be} about  {depth} but again there {be} probably places at {the} bottom {of} {the} {Arctic Ocean} that {be} {near} {to} {the} center {of} {the} Earth
The {Kola superdeep borehole} {be} only about 
We know something about {the} inside {of} {the} Earth though because we can learn things from {earthquake}s {and} {the} {time} when {volcano}es {Volcanic eruption}
We {be} able {to} {see} how quickly {the} {shock wave}s {Movement} through {Earth} {in} {different} places
The inside {of} {Earth} {be} very {different} from {the} outside
Almost all {of} {Earth} {liquid} {water} {be} {in} {the} {ocean}s or close {to} {the} surface
The {surface} also has {a} lot {of} {oxygen} which comes from plants
Small {and} {simple} {kind} {of} {life} can live {far} {under} {the} surface but {animals} {and} {plants} only live on {the} {surface} or {in} {the} seas
The {Stone} on {the} {surface} {of} {Earth} {Earths crust} {be} {well} known
They {be} thicker where there {be} land between  thick
Under {the} {ocean}s they {be} sometimes only  thick
There {be} three {group} {of} {Stone} that make {up} most {of} {the} {Earth} crust
Some {Stone} {be} made when {the} {Heat} {liquid} {Stone} comes from inside {the} {earth} {igneous rock}s another type {of} {Stone} {be} made when {sediment} {be} laid down usually {under} {the} {sea} {sedimentary rock}s {and} {a} {third} {kind} {of} {Stone} {be} made when {the} other two {be} changed by very high {temperature} or {pressure} {metamorphic rock}s
A very few {Stone} also {fall} {out} {of} {the} {sky} {meteorite}s
Below {the} {Crust geology} {be} {warm} {and} almost{liquid} {Stone} that {be} always moving around the {Earths mantle}
Then there {be} {a} thin {liquid} {layer} {of} {heat} {Stone} the {outer core}
This {be} very hot 
The {middle} {of} {the} inside {of} {the} {Earth} would {be} {liquid} {as} {well} but all {the} {weight} {of} {the} {Stone} above it pushes it {back} into being solid
This {solid} {middle} part the {inner core} {be} almost all {iron}
This {be} what makes {the} {Earth} {magnetic field}
{map} showing {the} {Earth} largest {and} most important {plate}   The {Earths crust} {be} {solid} but made {of} {plate tectonics} which {Movement} very slowly
The thin {level} {of} hard {Stone} on {the} outside {of} {the} {Earth} rests on {Heat} {liquid} {material} below it {in} {the} {deep} {mantle geology}
This {liquid} {material} {Motion physics} because it gets {heat} from {the} {Heat} center {of} {the} earth
The {slow} movement {of} {the} {plate} {be} what causes {earthquake}s {volcano}es {and} large {group} {of} {mountains} on {the} Earth
There {be} three ways {plate} can come together
Two {plate} can {Movement} towards each other convergent {plate} edges
This can {form} {island}s such {as} {Japan} {volcanoes} {and} high {mountain range}s such {as} {the} {Andes} {and} {Himalayas}
Two {plate} can {Movement} away from each other divergent {plate} edges
This gives {the} {magma} {a} place {to} come out
This makes {midocean ridge}s below {the} {sea} or large low {land} {like} {Africa}{be} {Great Rift Valley}
Plates {be} able {to} {Movement} beside each other {as} {well} transform {plate} edges such {as} {the} {San Andreas Fault}
This makes their {edge} crush {against} each other {and} makes many {earthquakes}
The outside {of} {the} {Earth} {be} {not} even
There {be} high places called {mountain}s {and} high {flat} places called {plateau}s
There {be} low places called {valley}s {and} {canyon}s
For {the} most part moving {wind} {and} {rain} {and} {tide}s {erosion}
The {air} {and} {water} then {Movement} these pieces {to} lower places
Because {of} this {the} {Earth} would have {be} very {flat} {a} {long} {time} before now
The fundamental cause {of} {the} differences {in} {the} {Earth} {surface} {be} {plate tectonics}
The {shape} {of} {the} entire {planet} itself {be} {not} {even} {a} ball
Because {of} its velocity {Earth} has {a} slight bulge at {the} {Equator}
Other than that {Earth} {be} {shape} more {like} {a} {pear} than {a} actual sphere
All places on {Earth} {be} made of or {be} on top of rocks
The outside {of} {the} {Earth} {be} usually {not} uncovered rock
Over 70{percent} {of} {the} {Earth} {be} {cover} by {ocean}s full {of} {salt}y water
This salty {water} makes {up} about 97{percent} {of} all {Earth} water
The {fresh water} {people} can {drink} {be} mostly {ice}
Only {a} very {small} {amount} {be} {in} {river}s {and} {under} {the} {Earth} for {people} {to} {drink} {and} use
The {air} above {the} {Earth} stops {the} {water} from going away into {outer space}
Also much {of} {the} {land} on {Earth} {be} {cover} with plants or with what {be} {left} from earlier {living} things
Places with very {little} {rain} {be} dry {waste} called {desert}s
Deserts usually have few {living} things but {life} {be} able {to} {cell growth} very quickly when these {waste} have rainfall
Places with large {amount} {of} {rain} {may} {be} {rain forest}
Lately {people} have changed {the} {environment} {of} {the} {Earth} {a} great deal
All around {the} {Earth} {be} {a} large {amount} {of} {air} the {atmosphere}
The {mass} {of} {the} {Earth} pulls {the} {gas}ses {in} {the} {air} {down} {and} does {not} let them {go} into outer space
The {air} {be} mostly made {of} {nitrogen} about 78{percent} {and} {oxygen} about {March 21}{percent} but there {be} {a} few other {gas} {as} well
Most {life form} {need} {the} {air} or {computer hardware} {of} {the} {air} gripped {in} {the} water {to} {breathe} {and} live
They use {the} gassesmdashespecially {oxygen} {and} {carbon dioxide}mdashto make {and} use {sugar} {and} {to} give themselves power
The {air} {animals} {and} {plants} use {to} live {be} only {the} first {level} {of} {the} {air} around {the} {Earth} the {troposphere}
The {day} {to} {day} changes {in} this {level} {of} {air} {be} {name} {weather} {the} changes between places {far} away from each other {and} from {year} {to} {year} {be} {name} {the} {climate}
{Rain} {and} {storm}s {be} both {in} this level
Both come about because this part {of} {the} {air} gets {cold} {as} it {go} up
{convection}
The turning {Earth} {Motion physics} {the} {air} {as} {well} {and} {air} {Motion physics} {north} {and} {south} because {the} {middle} {of} {the} {Earth} generally gets more {power} from {the} {Sun} {and} {be} {warm} than {the} {north} {and} {south} points
At {the} same time {air} over {water} specially very {warm} water {evaporation} but because {cold} {air} {be} {not} able {to} take {in} {as} much water it {start} {to} make {cloud}s {and} {rain} {as} it gets colder
The way {water} {Motion physics} around {in} {a} {circle} {like} this {be} called {the} {water cycle}
{History} {the} {Earth} has {be} much {warm} {and} much {cold} than it {be} now
Since {people} have grown used {to} {the} {heat} we have now though we do {not} {want} {the} {Earth} {to be} too much {warm} or colder
Most {of} {the} ways {people} {create} {electricity} use burning {kind} {of} {carbon}mdashespecially {coal} {oil} {and} {natural gas}
Burning these {create} {new} {carbon dioxide} {and} can cause more warming
A {climate change} {be} going on {now} about what {people} should do about {global warming} which has {go} on for about 150 years
So far this {warm} has {be} {goodness} for people {plants} have grown better {and} {the} {weather} has {be} better than {Little Ice Age}
Some {people} who learn about science though say that many bad things {will} possibly come about {if} {the} {warm} {go} on
About seven {billion} {people} live on Earth
They live {in} about 200 {different} {land} called {countries}
Some like {Russia} {be} large with many large cities
Others like {the Vatican} {be} small
The five {country} with {the} most {people} {be} {China} {India} {the} {United States} {Indonesia} {and} {Brazil}
About 90 {of} {people} live {in} {the} {northern hemisphere} {of} {the} world which has most {of} {the} land
{Scientist}s think that {people} originally came from {Africa}
Now 70 {of} all {people} do {not} live {in} {Africa} but {in} {Europe} {and} {Asia}
People change {the} {Earth} {in} many ways
They have {be} able {to} {cell growth} {plants} for {food} {and} {clothes} for about {ten} {thousand} years
When there {be} enough food they {be} able {to} build {town} {and} cities
Near these places {man} {and} {woman} {be} able {to} change rivers {irrigation} {and} stop {flood}s rising water from coming over their land
People found useful {animals} {and} {domestication} them so they {be} easier {to} keep

{ovary botany} In {botany} {a} {fruit} {be} {a} {plant} {structure} that contains {the} {plant} {seed}s
To {a} {botanist} {the} {word} {fruit} {be} used only {if} it comes from {the} part {of} {the} {flower} which {be} {a} {ovary botany}
It {be} {a} extra {layer} {round} {the} {seed}s which {may} or {may} {not} {be} fleshy
However {even} {in} {the} {field} {of} botany there {be} {no} {general} {agreement} on how {fruit} should {be} classified
Many do have extra {layer} from other {computer hardware} {of} {the} flower
In {general} speech {and} especially {in} {cooking} {fruit} {be} {a} {sweet} {product} {and} many {Botany} {fruit} {be} known {as} {vegetable}s
This {be} how ordinary {people} use {the} words
On this page we describe what {botanist}s call {a} fruit
The fleshy part {of} {a} {fruit} {be} called {the} mesocarp
It {be} between {the} {fruit} {skin} exocarp {and} {the} seeds
The {white} part {of} {a} {apple} for example {be} {the} fleshy part {of} {the} apple
Usually when we eat {a} fruit we eat {the} fleshy part
If {the} entire {fruit} {be} fleshy except for maybe {a} thin skin we call {the} {fruit} {a} {berry}
A {berry} might contain {one} {seed} or many
{Grape}s {avocado}s {and} {blueberry} {be} {Berry}
They all have {a} thin {skin} but most {of} {the} {fruit} {be} fleshy
{Strawberry} however {be} actually {not} berries because {the} {seeds} {be} on {the} outside on {a} {reality} berry {the} {seed} or {seeds} must {be} inside
A {pepo} pronounced pee po {be} {a}  berry
Its {skin} {be} hard {and} thick {and} {be} usually called {a} rind
{Pumpkin}s {and} {watermelon}s for instance {be} pepos
A {hesperidium} {be} another modified berry
It has {a} {leather}y {skin} that {be} {not} {as} hard {as} {the} {skin} {of} {a} pepo
All {citrus} {fruit} {like} {Orange fruit} {and} {lemon} {be} hesperidiums
A {pome} pohm {be} {a} {fruit} that has {a}  surrounded by fleshy {Tissue biology} that we can eat
The {Planetary core} {be} usually {not} eaten
{Berry} {be} {different}  {the} {seeds} {be} inside {the} fleshy part {not} separated from it by {a} core
{Apple}s {and} {pear}s {be} pomes
{Stone fruit} {be} also called {stone fruit}
A drupe {be} {a} fleshy {fruit} with {a} hard {stone} around {the} seed
We usually call this stone {the} pit {of} {the} fruit
{Peach}es {and} {Olive fruit} {be} drupes
Actually {the} {almond} {fruit} {be} {a} drupe too though we eat {the} {seed} that {be} inside {the} pit {of} {the} {almond} fruit
Since {fruit} {be} {produce} from fertilised {gynoecium} {in} {flower}s only {flowering plant}s {produce} fruits
Fruits {be} {a} {evolution}ary invention which {help} {seed}s get  by animals
The {Botany} {term} includes many that {be} {not} fruits {in} {the} {Common year} {sense} {of} {the} term such {as} {the} {vegetable} {Squash plant} {pumpkin}s {cucumber}s {tomato} {pea}s {bean}s {corn} {eggplant} {and} {sweet pepper} {and} some spices such {as} {allspice} {and} {chillie}s
{Strawberry} fruit {the} seeds {be} each derived from {a} {pistil} {of} {the} {flower} An {accessory fruit} or {false} {fruit} pseudocarp {be} {a} {fruit} {in} which some {of} {the} flesh {be} derived {not} from {the} {gynoecium} but from some adjacent tissue
A {fig} {be} {a} type {of} {accessory fruit} called {a} syconium
{Pome}s such {as} {apple}s {and} {pear}s {be} also accessory fruits {the} {Planetary core} {be} {the} {true} fruit
Strictly speaking these {be} {not} {Botany} fruits  
any {produce} by nonflowering plants {like} {juniper} berries which {be} {the} seedcontaining {female} {cone} {of} conifers 
fleshy fruitlike {growth} that develop from other {plant} {Tissue biology} like {rhubarb}
{Cranberry} {lingonberries} {blueberries} {red} {Huckleberry} These {be} {fruit} which {you} can {buy} {in} shops {and} which {be} also acceptable {as} {Botany} fruits 
{berry fruits} {redcurrant} {gooseberry} {cranberry} {blueberry} Also but {not} commonly known {as} {berry} fruits {be} {tomato} {avocado} {banana} 
{false berries} {blackberry} {strawberry} {raspberry} they {be} {aggregate fruit} see below
The {yew} {berry} {be} {not} {a} {fruit} at all because {the} {yew} {be} {a} {conifer} 
{stone fruit}s or drupes {plum} {cherry} {peach} {apricot} {Olive fruit} 
{citrus} {like} {orange fruit} {grapefruit}s {and} {tangerine}s 
{aggregate fruit}s {raspberry} {blackberry} 
{multiple fruit}s {pineapple}s {fig}s  Many {fruit} come from {tree}s or {shrub}
For plants {fruit} {be} {a} means {of} dispersal usually by {animal}s
When {the} {fruit} breaks apart {the} {seeds} can {go} into {the} {ground} {and} begin {to} grow
Most {fruit} we eat contain {a} lot {of} {water} {and} {Nature} {sugar}s {and} many {be} high {in} {Vitamin C}
They have {a} large {amount} {of} {dietary fibre}
Fruits {be} usually low {in} {protein} {and} {fat} content but {avocado} {and} some {Nut fruit} {be} exceptions {to} this
Not only {human}s but our closest {living} relatives {primate}s {be} keen fruiteaters
So {be} many other {group} {of} {herbivorous} {mammal}s {and} many {bird}s
Seedlessness {be} {a} important feature {of} some {fruit} {of} commerce
Commercial bananas pineapple {and} {watermelon}s {be} {example} {of} seedless fruits
Some {citrus} fruits especially oranges satsumas mandarin oranges {and} {grapefruit} {be} {value} for their seedlessness
Seedless {banana} {and} {grape} {be} {ploidy} {and} seedlessness results from {the} {abortion} {of} {the} {embryo}nic {plant} which {be} {produce} by fertilisation
The method requires normal {pollination} {and} fertilisation
{List of fruit}

{Goodness} can mean that something {be}  or it can mean {the} {amount} that something {be} good
What {goodness} {be} has {be} {talk} about by {Philosophy} who try {to} explain what {goodness} is
In {food} {goodness} {be} {the} part that {be} beneficial
{Geography} {be} {the} {research} {of} {the} {Earth} {and} its features its inhabitants {and} its phenomena
The {word} {geography} comes from {the} {Greek language} {word} g Earth {and} graphein to write draw
It means to {write} {and} {draw} about {the} Earth
The {word} {be} first used by {a} {scientist} called {Eratosthenes} 276194 BC
Its features {be} things {like} {continent}s {sea}s {river}s {and} {mountain}s
Its inhabitants {be} all {the} {people} {and} {animal}s that live on it
Its {phenomenon} {be} {the} things that happen {like} {tide}s {wind}s {and} {earthquake}s
A {person} who {be} {a} expert {in} {geography} {be} {a} geographer
A geographer tries {to} {knowledge} {the} {world} {and} {the} things that {be} {in} it how they {start} {and} how they have changed
{Geography} {be} {Division mathematics} into two main {computer hardware} called {physical geography} {and} {human} geography
{Physical geography} {Research} {the} {natural} {environment} {and} {human} {geography} {Research} {the} {human} environment
The {human} environmental {Research} would include things such {as} {the} {population} {in} {a} country how {a} {country} {economy} {be} doing {and} more
There {be} also environmental geography
Geographers {need} {to} know {a} lot about {map}s because {map} {be} very important for understanding geography
Geographers use {map} {a} lot {and} often make them
Making {map} {be} called {cartography} {and} similarly {people} who make {map} {be} cartographers
{Physical geography} sometimes also called physiography {be} {the} {natural science} that {cover} {the} {natural} {environment} {and} {the} {Earth} surface
A geographer {research} {physical geography} {may} look at  
{Biogeography} 
{Climatology} 
{Landscape ecology} 
{Geomorphology} 
{Glaciology} 
{Hydrology} 
{Meteorology} 
{Oceanography} 
{Palaeogeography} 
{Pedology}    {Human geography} {be} {the} {Social sciences} that {cover} {the} {research} {of} {people} {and} their communities cultures {economy} {and} their interaction with {the} environment
Geographers {research} {the} {human} {environment} {may} look at  
{Population}  
{Country} 
{Land use}  
{Agriculture} 
{City} 
{Industry} 
{Energy} 
{Pollution} 
{Air pollution}

{Blue shark} {Carp} {seahorse}
They {be} {camouflage}d {as} floating seaweed {Dunkleosteus} {a} giant armoured arthrodire {of} {the} later {Devonian}
Up {to} 6 {metre} long it lived {in} {the} {Inland sea}s {of} {North America}   Fish plural {fish} or fishes {be} {vertebrate}s which live {in} {water} {and} {respiration} get {oxygen} with {gills}
They lack {limb}s with digits fingers  toes
This {be} {a} {definition} which does {not} quite work some {amphibia} also live {in} {water} {and} have external gills but they {be} {not} fishes
Fish used {to be} {a} {class biology} {of} {vertebrates}
Now {the} {term} {cover} five {class biology} {of} aquatic vertebrates {Agnatha} {Placodermi} {Chondrichthyes} {Actinopterygii} {Sarcopterygii}  There {be} more {fish} than {tetrapods} land vertebrates there {be} over 33000 described {species} {of} fish
Fish {be} usually {cover} with scales
They have two sets {of} paired {fins} {and} several unpaired fins
Most {fish} {be} coldblooded {poikilotherm}
A {fish} takes {in} {the} {oxygen} from {the} {water} using {gills}
There {be} many {different} {kind} {of} fish
They live {in} {fresh water} {in} {lake}s {and} {river}s {and} {in} {salt water} {in} {the} {ocean}
Some {fish} {be} less than {one} {centimeter} long
The largest {fish} {be} {the} {whale shark} which can {be} almost {August 15} {metre} {long} {and} weigh {August 15} {ton}s
Most {fish} live {in} {the} water
A {group} {of} {fish} called {the} {lungfish} have developed {lung}s because they live {in} {river} {and} pools which dry {up} {in} certain {computer hardware} {of} {the} year
They burrow into mud {and} {aestivation} until {the} {water} returns
Fish {be} {a} {paraphyletic} {term} {in} {cladistics} because it lacks {a} {monophyletic} {group} {of} descendants
It does {not} include {the} {land} {vertebrates} or {tetrapod}s which descended from fish
Though often used interchangeably these {word} have {different} meanings
Fish {be} used either {as} singular {noun} or {to} describe {a} {group} {of} specimens from {a} single species
Fishes describes {a} {group} {of} {different} species
Fish {the} {old} {vertebrate} group includes {a} huge range {of} types from {the} {Middle Francia} {Ordovician} about 490 {million} {year} ago {to} {the} present day
These {be} {the} main groups  
{Agnatha} {the} jawless fish
{Cambrian} {to} present day 
{Pteraspid}s {the} headshields 
{Anaspid}s {gills} opened {as} holes
{Silurian} {to} end{Devonian} 
{Cephalaspid}s early jawless {fish} 
{Lamprey}s {living} ectoparasites 
{Osteostraci} bonyarmoured jawless fish 
{Gnathostomata} {the} jawed fish
Includes all types commonly called fish except {the} lamprey 
{Placoderm}s heavily armoured {fish} 
{Chondrichthyes} cartilaginous fish {shark}s {ray}s {and} {skate}s 
{Acanthodii} {extinct volcano} spiny {shark} 
{Osteichthyes} bony fish 
{Actinopterygii} {the} {rayfinned fish} 
{Chondrostei} {sturgeon}s {and} some other early types 
{Neopterygii} first {see} {in} {the} later Permian {density} {and} fastermoving than previous groups 
{Holostei} {the} {gar}s {and} {bowfin}s 
{Teleost}ei {the} most successful group {Triassic} {to} present day 
{Sarcopterygii} {the} {lobefinned fish} 
{Dipnoi} {the} {lungfish} eight {genera} survive 
{Coelacanth}s two {species} survive
They {be} probably {a} {sistergroup} {to} {the} {tetrapod}s
Certain {animals} that have {the} {word} {fish} {in} their {name} {be} {not} really fish {Crayfish} {be} {crustacean}s {and} {jellyfish} {be} {Cnidaria}ns
Some {animals} look {like} fish but {be} not
{Whale}s {and} {dolphin}s {be} {mammal}s for example
{physiology}
The {red} fibres {be} usually alongside {a} much greater {number} {of} {white} fibres
The {white} fibres get their {energy} by converting {the} {carbohydrate} {glycogen} {to} lactate {lactic acid}
This {be} {anaerobic metabolism} that is it does {not} {need} {oxygen}
They {be} used for fast {short} bursts
Once {the} {lactic acid} builds {up} {in} {the} muscles they stop working {and} it takes {time} for {the} lactate {to be} removed {and} {the} {glycogen} replaced
Using their {white} fibres {fish} can reach {speed} {of} 10 {length} per {second} for {short} bursts
Fishes with fusiform {shape} can chase prey {and} escape predators quickly
Many live {in} {the} open {ocean} {and} {swim} constantly {like} {marlin}s {swordfish} {and} {tuna}
{Ichthyosaur}s {porpoise}s {dolphin}s {killer whale}s all have similar shapes
This {be} {a} {example} {of} {convergent evolution}
The long ribbonlike {shape} {of} {a} {eel}{be} {body} shows another shape
This enables them {to} hide {in} cracks {spring} {out} quickly {to} {capture} prey then returning quickly {to} their hiding spot
{Flatfish} live on {the} bottom {of} {the} {ocean} or lake
Most use {camouflage} they change {color} {to} {match} {the} {ocean} floor
Fish with compressed {shape} have flat {vertical} bodies with {one} {eye} on each side
They {swim} upright {and} can {be} very thin
They usually live {in} {reef}s where their {flat} {bodies} can slip {in} {and} {out} among {the} {coral}s {sponge}s {and} rocks keeping hidden from predators
{Marine angelfish} {surgeonfish} {and} {butterflyfish} {be} all compressed fish
{Koi} and {goldfish} have {be} kept {in} decorative {pond} for {centuries} {in} {Ancient China} {and} Japa Some {people} eat fishes
Many {kind} {of} {fish} {be} eaten
The {fish} that {people} eat most include {carp} {cod} {herring} {perch} {sardine}s {sturgeon} {tilapia} {trout} {tuna} {and} many others
A {person} who {buy} {and} {sales} {fish} for eating {be} called {a} {fishmonger}
The {word} {to} {fish} {be} also used for {the} activity {of} catching fishes
People catch {fish} with {small} {Fishing net} from {the} {side} {of} {the} {water} or from {small} {boat}s or with big {Fishing net} from big boats
People can also catch {fish} with {fishing pole}s {and} fishhooks with {bait}
This {be} often called {angling}
Anglers also {different} types {of} {fishing lure}s
Because {people} {be} catching too many {fish} for {food} or other uses there {be} less {and} less {fish} {in} {the} sea
This {be} {a} {problem} known {as} {Overfishing}
{Selective breeding} {of} {carp} made them into {the} {domesticated} {koi} {in} {Japan} {and} {goldfish} {in} {China}
This breeding began over 2000 {year} ago
The {Chinese people} brought their {goldfish} indoors during {the} {Song Dynasty}
They kept them {in} large {ceramic} vessels
That we {now} do {in} {glass} {fish} tanks
Citizendium       
{Tokyo} {Japan}
The {glass} has two layers {a} coloured {layer} outside {a} {clear} laye  Glass {be} {a}  {material} that can {be} made {in} many {shape}s
It {be} usually {transparency} but it can also {be} made {in} {colour}s
Glass {be} mainly made {of} {silica} {glass} {be} made {of} {silica} only {be} called {silica} glass
Glass used {to} make {window}s {and} {bottle}s {be} {a} specific type called sodalime glass composed {of} about 75 {silicon dioxide} SiO {sodium oxide} NaO from {sodium carbonate} NaCO {Calcium oxide} CaO {and} several minor additives
By changing {the} proportions {and} {addition} {different} ingredients many {kind} {of} {glass} can {be} made
Coloured {glass} {be} made by {addition} {small} {amount} {of} {metal} oxides
For example {a} {blue} {color} {be} given by tiny {amount} {of} {cobalt oxide}
Crystal {glass} {be} made by {addition} {lead oxide} {and} {zinc oxide}s
It {be} {not} actually {a} {crystal} because all {glass} {be} {a} non{crystalline} solid
Crystal {glass} {be} called {cut} {glass} {if} it has {be} {cut} by hand  Cut glass {be} {glass} that has {be} decorated entirely by {hand} by use {of} rotating wheels
Cuts {be} made {in} {a} otherwise completely smooth {surface} {of} {the} {glass} by {worker} holding {and} moving {the} piece {against} {Time in Australia} {size} {metal} or {stone} wheels
Because {glass} {be} used {to} make {Lens optics} {the} {word} glasses means {eyeglasses}
The {myth} that {glass} {be} actually {a} {liquid} comes from {the} {fact} that {old} {window} {in} {house} {and} {church} 200300 {year} old {be} sometimes {a} {little} {out} {of} shape thicker at {the} bottom than {the} top
This {be} actually due {to} {the} {process} {of} {glass} making {in} {the} {past} which led {to} {the} {glass} pane being thicker at {one} {edge} than {the} other
It {be} sensible {to} install {the} {window} with {the} thick {edge} at {the} bottom
Sometimes {a} {window} can {be} found with {the} thick {edge} at {the} top {of} {the} window
Glass can {be} {Recycling} over {and} over
Glass {bottle} {and} jars can easily {be} {Recycling} {to} make {new} {glass} {bottle} {and} jars or used {in} {industry} {as} aggregate building material or sand

The Great Lakes {be} five large {lake}s {in} eastcentral {North America}
They hold 21 {of} {the} {world} {Surface area} {fresh water}
The {lake} are 
{Lake Superior} 
{Lake Michigan} 
{Lake Huron} 
{Lake Erie} 
{Lake Ontario}     Four {of} {the} Great Lakes {be} on {the} {border} between {Canada} {and} {the} {United States}
The other Lake Michigan {be} completely inside {the} United States
All together by {volume} they {be} {the} largest {group} {of} {fresh water} {lake} {in} {the} world
No {one} {of} {the} Lakes {be} larger than {Lake Baikal} {Russia} or {Lake Tanganyika} {East Africa}
The {cities} {of} {Chicago} {Illinois} 98 {million} people on Lake Michigan {Toronto} {Ontario} 55 million on Lake Ontario {Detroit} {Michigan} 53 million on {the} {Detroit} river {Montreal} {Quebec} 39 million on {the} {St Lawrence River} {Cleveland} {Ohio} 29 million on Lake Eyrie {and} {Ottawa} 12 million Ontario on {the} {Ottawa} River {be} on {the} shores {of} {the} Great Lakes or their rivers
Though {the} five {lake} have separate basins they {form} {a} single connected {body} {of} freshwater
The {lake} connect {the} eastcentral interior {of} {North America} {to} {the} {Atlantic Ocean} Ocean
{Water} flows from {Lake Superior} {and} {Lake Michigan} into Lake Huron then through {the} {Detroit River} into Lake Erie then through {Niagara Falls} into Lake Ontario {and} then through {the} {Saint Lawrence River} {to} {the} {Atlantic Ocean}
{Water} also {drain} from {the} {Chicago River} on {the} south
Many {river} flow through {a} large {watershed} into {the} lakes
The {lake} have about 35000 islands
The Great Lakes {region} includes {the} five {lake} {and} many {thousand} {of} {small} lakes often called inland lakes

It {be} initially {create} for use with {software} documentation but can {be} applied {to} other types {of} {Employment} {as} well such {as} {Wikipedia}
{As} {a} {copyright} license {the} {GFDL} {be} {a} type {of} {contract} between {the} creator {of} {a} copyrightable {Employment} such {as} {a} {book} {a} {encyclopedia} article {a} {painting} or {a} piece {of} {music} {and} anyone else who might {want} {to} use it
The {GFDL} {be} considered copyleft because {the} {license} {be} meant {to} make it easier {to} use {and} reuse {the} {copyright} work {not} {to} restrict its use
If {a} copyrightable {Employment} {be} released {under} {the} GFDL {the} creator {of} {the} {Employment} {be} saying that anyone else {may} reproduce distribute or modify {the} work {as} {long} {as} they follow {a} set {of} requirements specified {in} {the} GFDL
Among {the} requirements {of} {the} {GFDL} {be} that any {new} {Employment} {create} from {the} original {Employment} {be} also {license} {under} {the} GFDLthat is once something {be} {license} {as} GFDL it {will} always stay {license} {as} GFDL {and} anything which uses it also {be} {license} {as} GFDL Because {the} {license} reproduces {and} stays with {the} work this {be} sometimes called {a} {virus} license
  The {GFDL} also says that {in} {order} {to} distribute or modify {a} {Employment} {license} with {the} GFDL {the} reuser must give {credit} {to} any previous {author} {of} {the} work {and} include {a} {list} {of} changes they made {to} {the} work
Finally any {Employment} {license} with {the} {GFDL} must contain somewhere {the} entire text {of} {the} license
This provision has {be} criticized because it {be} {not} always easy {to} include {a} entire {long} {license} with {a} {copyright} work
In {a} book for example it {be} easy {to} include {one} extra {page} with {the} license but {if} {the} {Employment} {be} something {like} {a} song or {a} photograph it {be} {not} easy
The {GFDL} has other requirements that {be} more complicated

For example {in} {a} {book} {of} {poetry} it would {be} easy {to} {label} some poems {as} {license} {under} {the} {GFDL} {and} some {not} {license} {under} it
But it would {not} {be} easy {to} {label} {if} part {of} {a} {song} {be} {license} {as} {GFDL} {and} {the} rest {be} not so this would {not} {be} allowed
Any use {of} {GFDL} {material} which violates {the} {term} {of} {the} {GFDL} {be} potentially {copyright infringement}
A {number} {of} {online} projects use {the} GFDL
An {online} project {to} {license} its content {under} {the} {GFDL} {be} {Wikipedia}
The {GFDL} has {be} criticized by many {people} who wish that it made it {even} easier for content {to be} reused
Among {the} {criticism} {be} that it {be} very hard {to} combine {GFDL} {material} with other {copyleft} licenses that it {be} {not} always {clear} {and} easy {to} understand {and} that some {of} its requirements such {as} {the} invariant sections {be} {not} {free} at all
The {GFDL} {be} released {in} draft {form} for feedback {in} {September} 1999

{Grammar} {be} {the} {research} {of} words how they {be} used {in} sentences {and} how they change {in} {different} situations
The {Ancient Greek}s used {to} call it grammatik tkhn {the} {craft} {of} letters
It can have any {of} these meanings  The {research} {of} {a} {language} how it works {and} everything about it
This {be} background {research} on language  The {research} {of} {sentence} structure
Rules {and} {example} show how {the} {language} should {be} used
This {be} {a} correct usage grammar {as} {in} {a} {textbook} or manualguide  The {system} which {people} learn {as} they {cell growth} up
This {be} {the} nativespeakers grammar
When we speak we use {the} native persons grammar or {as} {near} {as} we can
When we write we try {to} {write} with correct grammar
So speaking {and} {writing} {a} {language} each have their {own} style
All {languages} have their {own} grammar
Most {Europe}{a} {languages} {be} rather similar but some such {as} {Chinese language} {and} {Japanese language} {be} very {different} from all {European people} languages
{English language} makes few changes {to} its {word} endings {suffix}es
In {the} {Italic} or Romance {languages} such {as} {French language} {Italian language} {and} {Spanish language} {word} endings carry {a} lot {of} meaning
In {English language} we have just {a} few {plural} {and} possessives Johns {be} {the} most common
In our {verb} we have {drop} most endings except one {I} love {you} love but she loves
That final s {be} {a} remnant {of} {Old English} which had more suffixes
Verbs do have endings which show changes {in} {Grammatical tense} walked walking
{Word order} {be} {the} other big difference
{Romance languages} normally put {adjective}s {after} {the} {noun}s {to} which they refer
For example {in} English {a} {person} {may} say {I} {like} {speed} cars but {in} {Spanish language} it {be} Me gustan los coches rpidos
The {order} {of} {the} {word} has changed {if} just {the} words without {the} grammar {be} {translation} into English it would mean to me they please {the} {car} fast
This {be} because {Spanish language} {and} {English language} have {different} {rule} about {word} order
In {German language} {verb} often come {near} {the} end {of} {sentence} as Die Katze {hat} {death} Nahrung gegessen whereas {in} {English language} we usually put them between {Subject grammar} {and} {Object grammar} as {the} {cat} has {Eating} {the} food
Written {grammar} changes slowly but spoken {grammar} {be} more {fluid}
Sentences which {English language} speakers find normal today might have seemed strange 100 {year} ago
And they might not because many {of} our favourite sayings come from {the} {Authorized King James Version} {of} {the} {Bible} {and} from {Shakespeare}
Different {people} speak with {grammar} that differs from that {of} other people
For example {people} who use {the} {dialect} called General {American English} {and} {Received Pronunciation} might say {I} didnt do anything while someone who speaks what {be} called {African American Vernacular English} or AAVE might say {I} didnt do nothing
{London} {working class} version {I} aint done nuffink
These {be} called double negatives {and} {be} found almost entirely {in} spoken English {and} seldom written
These differences {be} called {dialect}s
The {dialect} {a} {person} uses {be} usually decided by where they live
Even though {the} {dialect} {of} {English language} use {different} {word} or {word} order they {still} have {grammar} rules

{Christianity} consider {the}  {Holy Spirit} {to be} {God} {as} well {the} {third} {person} {of} God
In {the} {New Testament} there {be} three beings who {be} said {to be} {God} {in} {different} forms {the} Father {the} Son {and} {the} {Holy Spirit} also known {as} {the} Holy Ghost

The effect {of} personal {evil} {far} transcends {the} repercussions {humans} cause {to} {one} another {in} {the} world but affects {one} relationship with {God} {the} Father {and} that aspect {of} {the} {self} cannot {be} addressed through {one} {own} selfimprovement efforts but requires {God} {to} intervene {in} {order} {to} set {one} right

{Religion} {like} {Buddhism} {and} {Confucianism} involve {the} {worship} {of} many gods or sometimes {no} {deity} at all
Philosophers can {talk} about {God} or god sometimes they {talk} about {a} specific god but other {time} they {be} just {talk} about {the} {idea} {of} god
One {of} {the} earliest Western {Philosophy} {to} {write} about {God} {in} {a} {monotheism} way {be} {the} {Ancient Greece} {Aristotle} who describes {deity} {as} {the} Supreme Cause
{Aristotle} saw {God} {as} {a} being that makes everything happen but {be} {not} {influence} by anything else
There {be} also some {Philosophy} {problem} with God
One {of} them {be} called {God paradox}

One {of} {the} most {Common year} ways {be} {to} {limit} which parties who can for parliament or {limit} {the} parties access {to} {mass media} such {as} television
Another way {be} {to} rig {the} {vote} {system} by removing {vote} from opposition voters {and} substituting {vote} for {the} party {in} power

Under {a} {dictatorship} {the} {government} {be} run by {one} {person} who has all {the} {power} over {the} {people} {in} {a} country

The {Ancient Rome} {dictator} and {Ancient Greece} {tyrant}s {be} {not} always cruel or unkind but they did hold on {to} {power} all by themselves rather than sharing {power} with {the} people
The {Ancient Rome} {dictator} only held {power} for {a} {short} period {of} time
In modern times {a} {dictator} {rule} {be} {not} stopped by any laws constitutions or other {social} {and} {political} institutions {and} can last many {year} or {even} decades

The {people} who {rule} can allow {Ethnic groups in Afghanistan} {to} {own} land
It {be} {a}  by {government} that gives this {right} {in} {the} way that {law}s describe
Some think they have {the} {right} {to} hold {land} without {government} permission

Governments {of} {village}s {city} {county} {and} other {community} {be} subordinate {to} {the} {government} {of} {the} {state} or {province} where they exist {and} then {to} that {of} {the} {country}
It {be} from {King} {and} {feudalism} that modern {governments} {and} {nation state}s came
The {Capital city} {of} {a} country for instance {be} where {the} {King} kept his {asset}s
From this we get {the} modern {idea} {of} {capital economics} {in} {economics}
A {government} {may}  {trade} {as} {well} {as} {to} {rule} over land
Governments also {control} {people} {and} decide things about what {morality} {to} accept or {punish}

{Geometry} {be} {a} {kind} {of} {mathematics} that {Research} {the} {size} {shape}s {position} {and} {dimension} {of} things
We can only {see} or {draw} {shape} that {be}  {2D} or {solid} {3D} but {mathematician}s people who {research} math {be} able {to} {research} {shape} that {be} 4D 5D 6D {and} so on
{square geometry} {circle}s {and} {triangle}s {be} some {of} {the} {simple} {shape} {in} {flat} geometry
{Cube}s {cylinder}s {cone}s {and} {sphere}s {be} {simple} {shape} {in} {solid} geometry
Plane {geometry} can {be} used {to} {measure} {the} {area} {and} {perimeter} {of} {a} {flat} shape
{Solid geometry} can also {measure} {a} {solid} {shape} {volume} {and} {surface area}
{Geometry} can {be} used {to} calculate {the} {size} {and} {shape} {of} many things
For example {geometry} can {help} {people} find 
{the} {surface area} {of} {a} {house} so they can {buy} {the} {right} {amount} {of} {paint} 
{the} {volume} {of} {a} {box} {to} {see} {if} it {be} big enough {to} hold {a} {litre} {of} {food} 
{the} {area} {of} {a} {farm} so it can {be} {Division mathematics} into {equal} {computer hardware} 
{the} {distance} around {the} {edge} {of} {a} {pond} {to} know how much {fence} {to} {buy}
{Geometry} {be} {one} {of} {the} {old} {branch} {of} mathematics
{Geometry} began {as} {the} {art} {of} {measure} {the} {shape} {of} {land} so that it could {be} shared fairly between people
The {word} geometry means to {measure} {the} land
It has grown from this {to} become {one} {of} {the} most important {computer hardware} {of} mathematics
The {ancient Greece} {mathematician} {Euclid} {write} {the} first {book} about geometry {a} {book} called The Elements
Plane {and} {solid} geometry {as} described by {Euclid} {in} his {textbook} {Euclids Elements} {be} called Euclidean Geometry
This {be} simply called geometry for centuries
In {the} 19th century {mathematician} {create} several {new} {kind} {of} {geometry} that changed {the} {rule} {of} Euclidean geometry
These {and} earlier {kind} {be} called nonEuclidean not {create} by Euclid
For example {hyperbolic geometry} {and} {elliptic geometry} come from changing {Euclid} {parallel postulate}
{NonEuclidean geometry} {be} more complicated than Euclidean {geometry} but has many uses
{Spherical geometry} for {example} {be} used {in} {astronomy} {and} {cartography}
{Geometry} {start} with {a} few {simple} {idea} that {be} {thought} {to be} true called axioms
Such as 
A {point geometry} {be} shown on {paper} by {touch}ing it with {a} {pencil} or {pen} without making any sideways movement
We know where {the} {point} is but it has {no} {size} 
A {straight} {line} {be} {the} {short}est {distance} between two points
For example Sophie pulls {a} piece {of}  from {one} {point} {to} another point
A {straight} {line} between {the} two {point} {will} follow {the}  {of} {the} tight string 
A {Plane mathematics} {be} {a} {flat} {surface} that does {not}  {in} any {direction}
For example imagine {a} {wall} that extends {in} all {direction} infinitely

{Pinwheel galaxy} {be} {a} {spiral galaxy}   A {galaxy} {be} {a} huge {group} {of} many {star} {and} {Outer space} dust
The {word} galaxy {be} taken from {the} {Greek language} {word} galaxias where this {word} {go} {to} {the} {Milky Way} our galaxy
{Gravity} holds {Galaxy} together {against} {the} {general} {expansion of the universe}
In effect {the} {expansion of the universe} takes place between {group} {of} galaxies {not} inside those groups
This {be} because {the} {mass} {of} {a} {galaxy} holds {the} {galaxy} together {and} {the} same applies {to} {the} {group} {of} galaxies such {as} our {Local Group} where {Milky Way} {be} located
The gravitation {be} {produce} by {the} {matter} {and} {energy} {in} {a} {galaxy} or {group} {of} galaxies
Everything {in} {a} {galaxy} {Motion physics} around {a} {centre of mass} which {be} also {a} effect {of} gravity
There {be} {Time in Australia} types {of} galaxies {Elliptical galaxy} {Spiral galaxy} {and} {lenticular galaxy} galaxies which can all {be} with or without bars
Then there {be} {Irregular galaxy} galaxies
All {Galaxy} exist inside {the} {universe}
There {be} probably over 170 {billion} 17x10 {Galaxy} within {the} {observable universe}
There {be} {Galaxy} {of} {different} sizes
Typical {Galaxy} range from {Dwarf galaxy} with {as} few {as} {ten} {million} 10 {star} {up} {to} giants with {a} {hundred} {trillion} 10 stars all {orbit} {the} {galaxy} {center of mass}
{Galaxy} {may} contain many multiple {star} systems {star cluster}s {and} {Time in Australia} {interstellar cloud}s
The {Sun} {be} {one} {of} {the} {star} {in} {the} {Milky Way} galaxy {the} {Solar System} includes {the} {Earth} {and} all {the} other {Object grammar} that {orbit} {the} Sun
Star clusters {be} {not} galaxies they {be} inside galaxies
{Globular clusters} {be} sphericalshape {star cluster} which {be} part {of} {the} outer {halo} {of} {the} Milky Way
One {of} {the} largest and oldest known {star} clusters {Messier 15} has several {million} stars packed closely together with {a} {black hole} at its centre
The {star} {be} too closely packed {to} get {a} accurate count but it certainly has more {star} than some {of} {the} {small} galaxies
Within {galaxy cluster}s {Galaxy} {Movement} relative {to} other galaxies
They can {and} do collide
When this happens {the} {star} generally {Movement} {past} each other but {gas} {cloud} {and} {dust} interact {and} can {form} {a} {burst} {of} {new} stars
{Gravity} pulls both {Galaxy} into somewhat {new} shapes {form} bars {ring} or taillike structures
{constellation} Antila {produce} {new} {star} at {a} {rate mathematics} {of} 1 or {February 2} {star} per yea  Many {Galaxy} also continue {to} {form} {new} generations {of} stars
The Milky Way {and} all {Spiral galaxy} {shape} {Galaxy} {like} it see {right} {side} {image} {of} NGC 2997 {produce} {new} {star} at {a} {rate mathematics} {of} {one} or two {star} per year
This {star formation} happens {in} {the} vast {interstellar cloud} that {account} for about 1 {to} 10 {of} {the} {mass} {of} these galaxies
Globular {star} clusters on {the} other hand {be} {not} currently {form} {star} because this activity happened {billion} {of} {year} ago {and} then stopped once all {of} {the} {gas} {and} {dust} {cloud} {be} used up
In {the} {astronomy} {literature} {the} {word} Galaxy with {a} {capital city} {G} {be} used for our galaxy {the} {Milky Way}
The {billion} {of} other {Galaxy} {be} just {write} {as} galaxy with {a} lowercase g
The {term} {Milky Way} first came {out} {in} {the} {English language} {in} {a} poem by {Geoffrey Chaucer}
They {be} {Division mathematics} into two  
Barred {spiral galaxy} classified {as} SB 
Unbarred {spiral galaxy} classified {as} SA {NGC 1300} {and} {NGC 1672} {be} {example} {of} {bar} {Spiral galaxy} galaxy
{Whirlpool galaxy} {and} {Messier 81} {be} {example} {of} unbarred {Spiral galaxy} galaxy
The identifying characteristics {of} {a} {spiral galaxy} {be} diskshaped rotating {Spiral galaxy} arms {and} {a} bulge {in} {the} galactic core
The {Spiral galaxy} {arm} {be} where {new} {Heat} {star} {be} born
Bulge {in} {the} galactic {Planetary core} has {old} stars
This feature {be} {Common year} {to} {the} most {Spiral galaxy} galaxies
{ESO 325G004} {be} {a} {elliptical galaxy}  An {elliptical galaxy} {be} {a} {galaxy} that has {a} {ellipsoid} 3D {of} ellipse shape
This type {of} {galaxy} {be} {dominant} {in} {universe} especially {in} {galaxy cluster} The {size} {of} {a} {elliptical galaxy} can {be} {measure} {as} {a} {effective radius} which defines {the} {area} from which half its {light} comes
The {mass} {of} {elliptical galaxy} {be} also large
A giant {elliptical galaxy} can have {mass} {of} 10 many trillions {of} solar masses
{Lenticular galaxy} {NGC 5308}   The {simple} {definition} {of} {lenticular galaxy} {be} {a} {galaxy} {see} {in} {a} disc shape
Determining {the} {shape} {of} {a} {lenticular galaxy} {be} difficult because {the} {shape} can {be} between {spiral galaxy} {and} {Elliptical galaxy} galaxy
The {shape} can {be} known by looking at {the} bulge {of} {the} {galactic center}
If {the} bulge {be} very bright it {be} {a} {spiral galaxy}

While {Germany} {be} losing {the} war {Finland} had already progressed into {the} {Soviet Union} {in} {order} {to} regain {the} {area} lost {in} {the} previous peace
{Finland} {want} {to} end {the} {war} with {the} {Soviet} Union which resulted {in} peace
Once {again} {Finland} had {to} give {up} {the} {area} they had conquered
This time {the} {peace} with {the} {Soviet Union} made {Finland} {and} {Germany} enemies
Finns fought {the} Germans {and} {Germany} retreated {to} {Norway} burning {down} all {of} {Lapland} behind them

{Graph theory} {be} {a} {field} {of} {math}ematics about graphs
A {graph} {be} {a} {abstract} representation of {a} {number} {of} {point geometry}s that {be} connected by {line}s
Each {point} {be} usually called {a} {vertex} more than {one} {be} called vertices {and} {the} {line} {be} called edges
Graphs {be} {a} {tool} for modelling relationships
They {be} used {to} find answers {to} {a} {number} {of} problems
Some {of} these {question} are 
What {be} {the} best way for {a} {mailman} {to} get {to} all {of} {the} {house}s {in} {the} {area} {in} {the} least {amount} {of} {time}
The {point} could represent {street} corners {and} {line} could represent {the} {house} along {the} street see {Chinese postman problem}  
A salesman has {to} visit {different} customers but {want} {to} keep {the} {distance} traveled {as} {small} {as} possible
The {problem} {be} {to} find {a} way so they can do it
This {problem} {be} known {as} {Travelling Salesman Problem} and often abbreviated TSP
It {be} among {the} hardest {problem} {to} solve
If {a} commonly believed {conjecture} {be} {true} described {as} P  NP then {a} exact {solution} requires {one} {to} try all possible routes {to} find which {be} shortest
How many {color} would {be} {need} {to} {color} {a} map {if} {country} sharing {a} {border} {be} {color} differently
The {point} could represent {the} {different} {area} {and} {the} {line} could represent that two {area} {be} neighboring look at {the} {Four color theorem}  
Can {a} sketch {be} {draw} {in} {one} closed line
The {line} {of} {the} {drawing} {be} {the} {line} {of} {the} {graph} {and} when two or more {line} collide there {be} {a} {point} {in} {the} graph
The task {be} {now} {to} find {a} way through {the} {graph} using each {line} {one} time look at {Seven Bridges of Knigsberg}    
Graph {theory} has many aspects
Graphs can {be} directed or undirected
An {example} {of} {a} directed {graph} would {be} {the} {system} {of} {road} {in} {a} city
Some {street} {in} {the} {city} {be} {one} way streets
This means that on those {computer hardware} there {be} only {one} {direction} {to} follow 
Graphs can {be} weighted
An {example} would {be} {a} {road} network with distances or with {toll}s for roads 
The nodes the {circle} {in} {the} schematic {of} {a} {graph} {be} called {vertex}
The {line} connecting {the} nodes {be} called {edge}s
There can {be} {no} {line} between two nodes there can {be} {one} line or there can {be} multiple lines
{Leonhard Euler} used {to} live {in} {a} {town} called Knigsberg Its {name} changed {to} {Kaliningrad} {in} 1946
The {town} {be} on {the} {river} Pregel
There {be} {a} {island} {in} {the} river
There {be} some {bridge} {across} {the} river
Euler {want} {to} {walk} around {and} use each {of} {the} {bridge} once
He asked {if} {he} could do this
In 1736 {he} published {a} {Science} article where {he} showed that this {be} {not} possible
Today this {problem} {be} known {as} {the} {Seven Bridges of Knigsberg}
The article {be} {see} {as} {the} first {paper} {in} {the} {history} {of} {graph} theory
This article {as} {well} {as} {the} {one} {write} by {AlexandreThophile Vandermonde} on {the} {Knights tour} carried on with {the} {Mathematical analysis} situs initiated by {Gottfried Leibniz}
Eulers formula {be} about {the} {number} {of} edges vertices {and} {face} {of} {a} {convex} {polyhedron} {be} {research} {and} generalized by {Augustin Louis Cauchy} {and} {Simon Antoine Jean LHuillier} {and} {be} at {the} origin {of} {topology}
Over {a} {century} {after} Euler {Arthur Cayley} {research} {a} special {class biology} {of} graphs called {the} {tree graph theory}
A {tree} {be} {a} {graph} where there {be} only {one} {orbit} between two vertices
{Arthur Cayley} tried {to} solve {a} {problem} from {differential calculus}
His {solution} {influence} {the} {development} {of} {theory} {chemistry}
The technique {he} used mainly focused on {list} all {graph} which had certain properties
Today this {be} called Enumerative {graph} theory
It developed from {Arthur Cayley} results {a} {Science} publication done by  {George Plya} between {1935} {and} {1937} {and} {the} generalization {of} these by {Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn} {in} 1959
{Arthur Cayley} linked his results on {tree graph theory} with {the} contemporary {Research} {of} {chemical industry} composition
The fusion {of} {the} {idea} coming from {mathematics} with those coming from {chemistry} {be} at {the} origin {of} {a} part {of} {the} {standard} terminology {of} {graph} theory
In particular {the} {term} graph {be} introduced by {James Joseph Sylvester} {in} {a} article published {in} 1878 {in} {Nature journal}
One {of} {the} most famous {and} productive {problem} {of} {graph} {theory} {be} {the} {four color problem} Is it {true} that any {map} {draw} {in} {the} {fixedwing aircraft} {may} have its {region} {color} with four colors {in} such {a} way that any two {region} having {a} {Common year} {border} have {different} colors
 This {problem} {be} first posed by {Francis Guthrie} {in} 1852 {and} its first {write} {record} {be} {in} {a} {letter} {of} {Augustus De Morgan} addressed {to} {William Rowan Hamilton} {the} same year
Many incorrect {Proof mathematics} have {be} proposed including those by Cayley {Alfred Bray Kempe} {and} others
The {research} {and} {the} generalization {of} this {problem} by {Peter Guthrie Tait} {Percy John Heawood} {Frank P Ramsey} {and} {Hugo Hadwiger} led {to} {the} {research} {of} {the} colorings {of} {the} {graph} embedded on {surface} with arbitrary {Genus mathematics}
{Peter Guthrie Tait} reformulation generated {a} {new} {class biology} {of} problems {the} factorization problems particularly {research} by {Julius Petersen} {and} {Dnes Knig}
The {Employment} {of} {Frank P Ramsey} on colorations {and} more specially {the} results obtained by {Pl Turn} {in} {1941} {be} at {the} origin {of} another {branch} {of} {graph} theory {extremal graph theory}
The {four color problem} remained unsolved for more than {a} century
A {Proof mathematics} {produce} {in} {1976} by {Kenneth Appel} {and} {Wolfgang Haken} which involved {check} {the} {property} {of} 1936 configurations by computer {be} {not} fully accepted at {the} {time} due {to} its complexity
A {simple} {Proof mathematics} considering only 633 configurations {be} given twenty {year} later by {Neil Robertson mathematician} {Paul Seymour mathematician} {Daniel Sanders mathematician} {and} {Robin Thomas mathematician}
The {autonomy} {development} {of} {topology} from 1860 {and} {1930} fertilized {graph} {theory} {back} through {the} {Employment} {of} {Camille Jordan} {Kazimierz Kuratowski} {and} {Hassler Whitney}
Another important factor {of} {Common year} {development} {of} {graph} {theory} {and} {topology} came from {the} use {of} {the} techniques {of} modern algebra
{2017 Westminster attack} {example} {of} such {a} use comes from {the} {Employment} {of} {the} physicist {Gustav Kirchhoff} who published {in} {1845} his {Kirchhoffs circuit laws} for calculating {the} {voltage} {and} {Electric current} {in} {electric circuit}s
{Graph theory} {be} {a} important part {of} {mathematics} {and} {computer} science
To many such problems exact {solution} do exist
Many {time} however they {be} very hard {to} calculate
Therefore very often {approximation}s {be} used
There {be} two {kind} {of} such approximations {MonteCarlo algorithm}s {and} {LasVegas algorithm}s
Graphs {be} normally represented by two {different} sets typically set {a} {graph} {G} would {be} represented {as} {the} collection {of} {the} sets V {and} E
The set V {be} {a} discrete set containing all {vertex} {of} {the} graph
The set E {be} {a} {binary} set whose pairwise {Chemical element} {be} {Chemical element} {of} set V
Each pair {in} set E represents {a} {edge} connecting two vertices
If every two nodes have {a} {edge} between them then {the} {graph} {be} called {the} complete graph
The Island {of} Hawaii {be} {the} largest {United States} {Hawaiian Islands} {and} it {be} {the} {far} south

  One way {to} think about {Mental illness} {health} {be} by looking at how {well} {a} {person} functions
Feeling  {and}  being able {to} handle normal {level} {of} {Stress medicine} have {goodness} {friend} {and} family {and} {lead} {a}  life {and} being able {to} bounce back or  from hardships {be} all {Sign language} {of} {Mental illness} health
{Public health} refers {to} trying {to} stop {a} {disease} that {be} unhealthy {to} {the} community {and} does {not} {help} {in} {long} {life} or promote your health
This {be} fixed by {organisation} efforts {and} {choice} {of} society public {and} {private} clubs {community} {and} individuals
It {be} about {the} {health} {of} many people or everybody rather than {one} person
{Public health} stops instead {of} encouraging {a} {disease} through {Disease surveillance} {of} cases
To prevent being sick it {be} {goodness} {to} {act} according {to} some {simple} advice  {Hand washing} regular checkups  {vaccination} programmes drinking clean {water} {and} using {condom}s
When {infectious disease}s break out {wash} {hand} for about 30 {second} {may} {be} especially important
Sometimes it {be} {necessary} {to} avoid {mass} {of} {people} or wear {a} surgical mask {to} protect yourself {and} {to} stop {the} spreading {of} {the} disease
Teaching {people} how {to} live healthily {and} educate them especially about {sex} {and} childbirth {be} also very important

Thousands {of} {year} ago {Iberian}s {and} {Celt}s lived there {and} {the} {Phoenicians} made {a} few {cities} there {to} get {tin} {and} {silver} {to} trade
The {Roman Empire} {control} {Spain} for three {hundred} years then {people} from {Eastern Europe} called {Visigoths} fought for Spain won it from {the} Romans {and} {control} {Spain} for over two {hundred} years
{Lady of Elche} made by {the} {Iberian}   The {Visigoths} converted from {Arian Christianity} {to} {Roman Catholicism}
The {land} {be} won {after} {a} {war} by {Muslims} who {be} {Arab} {and} {Berber people}
{Roman Catholicism} from {Europe} eventually decided {to} {fight} {to} take {Spain} from {the} Muslims
They fought {war} for many {hundred} {of} years some {of} which {be} {Crusades} {against} other {Christian}s {like} {the} {Cathar}s
These {be} very cruel wars
In {the} {year} {1492} they took {the} last part {of} {Spain} that had belonged {to} {the} Moors
{Boabdil} {the} last {Moor}ish Leader {of} {Granada} gave {the} {city} {to} {King} Ferdinand {of} {Aragon} on {2 January} {1492} {and} {Christianity} {now} {rule} all {of} Spain
Before this several {different} {king} had {rule} {different} {country} {in} what {be} {now} called Spain
Two {of} these countries {Kingdom of Castile} {and} {Aragon} came together when {the} {king} {of} Aragon {Ferdinand II of Aragon} {married} {the} {queen} {of} Castile {Isabella of Castile}
In {the} same year 1492 they decided {to} send {Christopher Columbus} {to} explore {the} {Atlantic Ocean}
Columbus found {a} {land} there that {the} {people} {of} {Europe} did {not} yet know
These {be} {the} {island} {of} {the} {Caribbean Sea}
Columbus {and} other sailors explored more {and} found that there {be} two {continent}s there  {North America} {and} {South America}
{Spain} sent many {soldier} {and} businessmen {to} {North Africa} {and} {South} America {and} they took over very large {computer hardware} {of} those two continents
Owning this {empire} made {Spain} very rich
But when they {invasion} that empire they {kill} {million} {of} {the} {Native American}s who had lived there before
{Spain} {ownership} this {empire} for more than three {hundred} years
Meanwhile at home {the} {Islam} manuscripts had {be} either burnt or spread {to} other countries
{Judaism} had {be} expelled from Spain

Among {the} few things kept {and} respected {in} {Spain} {be} {in} {music} {harmony} {and} {stringed instrument}s {and} {of} course {the} buildings many {of} which became churches by {addition} crosses
The {Spanish Empire} {be} {the} strongest {in} {the} {world} through most {of} {the} next two centuries thanks {to} {gold} from {the} {Americas}
This {new} {gold} made rulers {and} colonial governors rich
Meanwhile others savings became worth less due {to} {inflation}
{Spain} became {a} {society} {of} very rich {and} very poor
Some {of} {the} {Poverty} {go} {to} {the} {new} {colony} {in} {the} {Caribbean} {Central America} {and} {South America} mostly {to} find gold
{Native American} {people} {be} {kill} by {disease}s brought by {the} Spaniards but most {Spaniards} did {not} know this
They found damaged {and} {dying} {society} with {people} who had lost some {of} their most important {leader} {and} thinkers
The {Spaniards} {thought} this meant they {be} inferior {and} used this {as} {a} excuse {to} enslave {the} natives
Millions {of} natives {death} {mining} {gold} for {the} Spanish
The {Spanish Empire} also at this {time} funded {the} {Spanish Inquisition} which tortured {and} {kill} anyone who disagreed with {the} {Roman Catholic Church}
The {Reformation} which {create} {Protestant} {sect}s {in} {Europe} {be} {not} allowed into Spain it {be} kept {out} and {as} with {Judaism} or Muslims its believers {be} killed
The {noble}s {of} {Spain} {no} longer had {to} {fight} anyone since {the} internal feuds {be} over
No {one} could challenge their power
In many ways it {be} held together {as} {a} {reign of terror}
People who challenged them {be} often called {heretic}s so that {the} {Inquisition} could torture them {and} then {noble} take {the} property
For ordinary {people} on both {side} {of} {the} {Atlantic Ocean} {life} got worse
A few rulers got rich
Today we would say that these {people} {be} {Guilt law} {of} {war crime}s {genocide} {and} {crimes against humanity}
Many Church {people} who had {the} {power} {to} speak {out} at that time did so {and} they said many {of} {the} same things {as} we would say today
But none {of} this {matter} much {to} {the} rulers
The great {satire} {Don Quixote} {be} {write} about this time
In {the} {18th century} there {be} {doubt} over who should become {king} {of} Spain this {doubt} led many {of} {the} {king} {of} {Europe} {to} {fight} {to} become {king} {of} Spain
This {be} called {the} {War of the Spanish Succession}
{France} occupied {Spain} for {a} {long} time
This made {Spain} very weak
It also made {Spain} lose its {empire} {in} {North Africa} {and} {South} America all {of} {the} {computer hardware} {of} that {empire} became their {own} countries or {be} taken over by other {country} such {as} {the} {United States}
There {be} {not} much {peace} {in} {Spain} during {the} first part {of} {the} {20th century}
Some {Spaniards} tried {to} set {up} {a} {government} {choice} by {the} {people} a {democracy} {and} they made {the} {King} {of} {Spain} leave {the} country
However {in} {1936} two {different} {group} {of} {Spaniards} {go} {to} {war} over whether {the} {government} should {be} {a} democracy or take {order} from {one} person
In {1939} those who {want} {democracy} {be} defeated {and} {a} {dictator} {name} {Francisco Franco} took over {the} government
Franco {death} {in} {1975}
He had decided that {Spain} should have {a} {king} again {and} {he} chose {Juan Carlos I of Spain} {the} grandson {of} {the} {king} who had {be} {Force physics} {to} leave {the} country {to be} king
But {the} {king} did {not} {rule} {as} {a} dictator instead {he} chose {to} set {up} {a} democracy
Also since Francos death {Spain} appointed {Adolfo Surez} {to} became Spains first {Democracy} {election} {Prime Minister of Spain}
Now {Spain} {be} {a} modern {democracy} country {and} does {business} with many {country} around {the} world

In its pure {form} on Earth {hydrogen} {be} usually {a} {gas}
Hydrogen {be} also {one} {of} {the} {computer hardware} that make {up} {a} {water} molecule
Hydrogen {be} important because it {be} {the} {fuel} that {power math} {the} {Sun} {and} other stars
Hydrogen makes {up} about 74 {of} {the} entire {universe}
Hydrogens {symbol} on {the} {Periodic Table} {of} {Euclids Elements} {be} H
Pure {hydrogen} {be} normally made {of} two {hydrogen} {atoms} connected together
{Scientist} call these {diatomic} {molecules}
Hydrogen {will} have {a} {chemical reaction} when {mixed} with most other elements
It has {no} {color} or {Odor}
Pure {hydrogen} {be} very uncommon {in} {the} {Earth}{be} {atmosphere}
In nature it {be} usually {in} {water}
Hydrogen {be} also {in} all {living} things {as} {a} part {of} {the} {organic compounds} that {life form} {be} made of
In addition {hydrogen} {atoms} can combine with {carbon} {atoms} {to} {form} {hydrocarbons}
{Petroleum} {and} other {fossil fuels} {be} made {of} these {hydrocarbons} {and} commonly used {to} {create} {energy} for {human} use
Hydrogen has two {different} {isotopes} called {deuterium} {and} {tritium}
Like regular hydrogen they both have only {one} {proton} {and} {one} {electron} but {deuterium} also has {one} {neutron} {and} {tritium} has two

The {electrolysis of water} easily breaks {water} into {hydrogen} {and} oxygen using electricity
Burning {hydrogen} combines with {oxygen} {molecules} {to} make {steam} pure {water} vapor
A {fuel cell} combines {hydrogen} with {a} {oxygen} {molecule} releasing {a} {electron} {as} electricity
For these reasons many {people} believe {hydrogen} {power} {will} eventually replace other {synthetic fuel}s
Hydrogen can also {be} used {as} {fuel} {in} {a} {fuel cell} or {burn} {to} make {heat} for {steam turbine}s or {internal combustion engine}s
Hydrogen can {be} {create} from many {source} such {as} {coal} {natural gas} or electricity {and} therefore represents {a} {valuable} {addition} {to} {the} {power grid} {in} {the} same role {as} {natural gas}
Such {a} grid {and} infrastructure with  {be} {now} planned by {a} {number} {of} {country} including Japan {Korea} {and} many {European people} countries
This allows these {country} {to} {buy} less {petroleum} which {be} {a} {economic} advantage
The other advantage {be} that used {in} {a} {fuel cell} or {burn} {in} {a} combustion {engine} or turbine there {be} {no} pollution

Jargon {be} {a} special way {to} use {word} that {be} shared only by {a} certain {group} {of} people
They do {not} mean what {the} {dictionary} says they mean
They have {different} {meaning}s {to} {the} {people} using them than their everyday meaning
For example {the} ordinary {word} boot net {and} web also have special {meaning} for users {of} {computer}s {the} {Internet} {and} {the} {World Wide Web}
These {and} {to} {flame} {to} {ping} {and} many {acronym}s {be} part {of} {Internet slang}
An {acronym} means that only some {of} {the} {letter} {in} {the} {word} or {phrase} {be} used
Often this {be} {the} first {letter} {of} each word
Other {acronym} found {online} {be} simply {Common year} shorthand

Usually more {jargon} {be} {create}d over time
Jargon {be} also {Common year} {in} {the} {military}
It includes {phrase}s {like} {SNAFU}

{Immunology} {be} {the} {research} {of} {the} {immune system}
The {immune system} {be} {the} {computer hardware} {of} {the} {body} which {Employment} {against} {infection} {and} {parasitism} by other {living} things
{Immunology} deals with {the} working {of} {the} {immune system} {in} {health} {and} diseases {and} with malfunctions {of} {the} immune system
An {immune system} {be} present {in} all {plants} {and} animals
We know this because {biologists} have found {genes} {code} for {tolllike receptor}s {in} many {different} {metazoa}ns
These {tolllike receptor} can recognise {bacteria} {as} foreign {and} {be} {the} startingpoint for immune reactions
The type {of} {immunity} which {be} triggered by {the} {tolllike receptor} {be} called {innate immunity}
This {be} because it {be} entirely {Heredity} {in} our {genome} {and} {be} fully working {as} soon {as} our {Tissue biology} {and} {Organ anatomy} {be} properly developed
{Vertebrate}s {and} only vertebrates have {a} {second} type {of} immunity
This {be} called {adaptive immunity} because it remembers previous infections
Then {if} {the} same {infection} occurs again {the} {reaction} {be} much stronger {and} faster
This immunological {memory} confers {a} tremendous {survival} advantage {and} with it {vertebrates} can {survive} over {a} {long} lifetime {in} {a} pathogenfilled environment
In {the} 18th century {Pierre Louis Maupertuis} made {Experiment} with scorpion venom {and} {Astronomy} that certain {dog} {and} {computer mouse} {be} immune {to} this venom
This {and} other {observation} {of} acquired {immunity} led {to} {Louis Pasteur} 18221895 developing {vaccination} {and} {the} {germ theory of disease}
Pasteurs {theory} {be} {in} direct opposition {to} contemporary {theory} {of} disease such {as} {the} {miasma theory of disease}
It {be} {not} until {the} {Proof mathematics} {Robert Koch} 18431910 published {in} {1891} for which {he} {be} awarded {a} {Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine} {in} 1905 that {microorganism}s {be} confirmed {as} {the} cause {of} {infectious disease}
{virus biology} {be} confirmed {as} {human} pathogens {in} 1901 when {the} {yellow fever} {virus} {be} discovered by {Walter Reed} 18511902
{Immunology} made {a} great advance towards {the} end {of} {the} 19th century through rapid developments {in} {the} {research} {of} {humoral immunity} {and} {cell biology} immunity
Particularly important {be} {the} {Employment} {of} {Paul Ehrlich} 18541915 who proposed {the} {sidechain theory} {to} explain {the} specificity {of} {the} antigenantibody reaction
The {Nobel Prize} for {1908} {be} jointly awarded {to} Ehrlich {and} {the} founder {of} {cell biology} immunology {Ilya Mechnikov} 18451916

{infinity symbol} {Infinity} {be} about things which never end
Sometimes it {be} also {write} 
{Infinity} means many {different} things depending on when it {be} used
The {word} {be} from {a} {Latin} word which means without end
{Infinity} {go} on forever so sometimes space numbers {and} other things {be} said {to be} infinite because they never come {to} {a} stop
{Infinity} {be} {not} really {a} ordinary number but it {be} sometimes used {as} one
{Infinity} often says how many there {be} {of} something instead {of} how big something is
For example there {be} infinitely many {whole number}s called {integer}s but there {be} {no} {integer} which {be} infinitely big
But {different} {kind} {of} {list of mathematics topics} have {different} {kind} {of} infinity
So its {meaning} often changes
There {be} two {kind} {of} infinity {potential} {infinity} {and}  infinity
Potential {infinity} {be} {a} {process} that never stops
For example {addition} 10 {to} {a} number
No {matter} how many {time} 10 {be} added 10 more can {still} {be} added
Actual {infinity} {be} {a} more {Abstraction} idea
For example there {be} infinitely many {number} {as} it {be} impossible {to} {write} them all down
{Mathematicians} have {different} {size} {of} {infinity} {and} three {different} {kind} {of} infinity
The {number} {of} things beginning with 0 1 2 3  {to} include {infinity} cardinal numbers
There {be} many {different} cardinal numbers
{Infinity} can {be} defined {in} {one} {of} two ways {Infinity} {be} {a} {number} so big that {a} part {of} it can {be} {of} {the} same size {Infinity} {be} larger than all {of} {the} {natural numbers}
There {be} {a} {small} {infinity} number countable infinity
It {be} {the} counting {number} for all {of} {the} whole numbers
It {be} also {the} counting {number} {of} {the} {rational numbers}
The {mathematics} notation {be} {the} {Hebrew language} {letter} {aleph} with {a} subscrpt zero 
It {be} spoken aleph null
It {be} {a} {surprise} {to} learn that there {be} larger {infinity} numbers
{be} 
The {number} {of} {mathematics} {functions} {be} {the} next {infinity} cardinal number 
And these {number} {go} on without end
A {different} type {of} {infinity} {be} {the} {ordinal numbers} beginning first second third 
The {order} first second third  {and} so on {to} {infinity} {be} {different} from {the} {order} ending  third second first
The difference {be} important for {mathematical induction}
The {simple} first second third 
has {the} {mathematics} name {the} {Ancient Greece} {letter} {omega letter} with subscript zero  Or simply {omega letter} 
 The {infinity} {television programme} ending  third second first {be} 
The {third} type {of} {infinity} has {the} {symbol} 
This {be} treated {as} {addition} {to} {the} {real numbers} or {the} {complex numbers}
It {be} {the} result {of} {Division mathematics} by zero or {to} indicate that {a} {series} {be} increasing or decreasing without bound
The {television programme} 1 2 3  increases without upper bound
This {be} written {the} {limit} {be} 
In {calculus} {the} {integral} over all {real numbers} {be} written    Each {kind} {of} {infinity} has {different} rules
Addition with alephs {be} {commutative}
Multiplication with alephs {be} commutative

Addition with omegas {be} {not} commutative
Multiplication with omegas {be} {not} commutative
Otherwise {Division mathematics} by {infinity} {be} {not} meaningful
Subtraction with {infinity} {be} {not} meaningful

These tablets {be} over 5000 {year} old
The {Library} {of} Alexandria {in} Egypt {be} {the} largest {and} most important {library} {of} {the} {Ancient history} world
It {be} destroyed when {the} {Roman Empire} {invasion} {Egypt} {in} 30 BC
Romes first public {library} {be} established by Asinius Pollio who {be} {a} lieutenant {of} Julius Caesar
Eventually {Ancient Rome} would build {1 E11 m} public {library} within {the} city
When {the} {Roman Empire} fell {in} 330 AD many {book} {go} {east} {to} {the} {city} {of} {Byzantium} where {a} large {library} {be} built

{Linear algebra} {be} {a} {branch} {of} {mathematics}
It came from {mathematicians} trying {to} solve {system} {of} {linear equation}s
{Vectors} {and} {matrix} {be} used {to} solve these systems
The main {Object grammar} {of} {research} currently {be} {vector space}s {and} {linear mapping}s between {vector} spaces
{Linear algebra} {be} useful {in} other {branch} {of} {mathematics} eg
{differential equations} {and} {analytic geometry}
It can also {be} applied {to} {the} {reality} {world} {in} {area} such {as} {engineering} {physics} {and} {economics}
Linear {algebra} describes ways {to}  {and} manipulate rearrange {system} {of} linear {equation}s
For example consider {the} following equations    These two {algebraic equation} {form} {a} {system} {of} linear equations
It {be} linear because none {of} {the} {variable}s {be} raised {to} {a} {exponentiation}
The {graph} {of} {a} {linear equation} {in} two {variable} {be} {a} {straight} {line}
The {solution} {to} this {system} is    This {be} because it makes all {of} {the} original {algebraic equation} valid that is {the} {value} on {the} {left} {side} {of} {the} {equals sign} {be} exactly {the} same {as} {the} {value} on {the} {right} {side} for both equations
{Linear algebra} uses {a} {system} {of} notation for describing {system} behavior called {a} {matrix mathematics}
For {the} previous example {the} {coefficient}s {of} {the} {algebraic equation} can {be} {store} {in} {a} {coefficient} matrix
{Legislature} {be} {a} {word} that comes from {the} {Latin} language {meaning} those who {write} {the} {law}s

Each {person} {in} {the} {legislature} {be} usually either {election} or appointed
The {constitution} {of} that {state} or {country} usually tells how {a} {legislature} {be} supposed {to} work
In many countries {the} {legislature} {be} called {a} {Parliament} {Congress} or {National Assembly}
Sometimes there {be} two {group} {of} members {in} {the} legislature
This {be} called {a} {bicameralism} legislature
A unicameral {legislature} has only {one} {group} {of} members
A {country} {district} {city} or other {small} {area} {may} also have something {like} {a} legislature
These {be} often called {council} {and} they make {small} {laws} for their areas

1 {litre}  1 dm   The {metric system} {be} first introduced {in} {France} {in} 1791
That {system} did {not} have its {own} {unit} {of} {capacity} or {volume} because {volume} can {be} {measure} {in} {cube} metres
The cadil {be} also known {as} {the} pinte or {the} litron
The pinte had {be} {a} {old} {French language} {unit} {of} {measure} {of} {capacity}
In 1795 {the} {definition} {be} revised
The cadil {be} given {the} {name} litre
In 1795 {the} {kilogram} {be} defined {to be} exactly {one} {litre} {of} {water} at 4C
In 1799 {the} {kilogram} {be} redefined
The {new} {definition} said that {the} {kilogram} {be} {the} {mass} {of} {the} {kilogram}
In {1901} {scientists} {measure} {the} {volume} {of} {one} {litre} {of} {water} at 4C very carefully
They found that it occupied about dm
The BIPM redefined {the} {litre} {as} being exactly {the} {volume} {of} {one} {kilogram} {of} {water} at 4C
In {1960} {the} {International System of Units} {be} introduced
The BIPM changed {the} {definition} {of} {the} {litre} {back} {to} one dm
The {litre} {be} {not} part {of} SI
The BIPM defined {the} {litre} {as} {a} NonSI {unit} accepted for use with {the} SI
This {be} because it {be} used {in} many  countries
The BIPM said that {the} {litre} should {not} {be} used very very accurate work
According {to} {SI} rules {the} {symbol} for {the} {litre} should {be} l
This {be} because {the} {litre} {be} {not} {name} {after} somebody whose {name} {be} Litre
However {the} {symbol} l {and} {the} {number} 1 {be} easily confused
In {1979} {the} BIPM made {a} exception for {the} {symbol} for {the} litre
They said that {people} could use either L or l {as} its symbol
{Mathematics} {be} {the} {research} {of} {number}s {shape}s {and} {pattern}s
The {word} comes from {the} {Greek language} {word}  mthema {meaning} {science} {knowledge} or {learning} {and} {be} sometimes shortened {to} {maths} in {England} {Australia} {Ireland} {and} {New Zealand} or {list of mathematics topics} in {the} {United States} {and} {Canada}
The {short} {word} {be} often used for {arithmetic} {geometry} or {simple} {algebra} by {student}s {and} their {schools}
{Mathematics} includes {the} {Education} of  
Numbers how things can {be} {Counting} 
{Structure} how things {be} {organisation}
This subfield {be} usually called {algebra} 
Place where things {be} {and} their arrangement
This subfield {be} usually called {geometry} 
Change how things become different
This subfield {be} usually called {Mathematical analysis}
{Mathematics} {be} useful for solving {problem}s that occur {in} {the} {reality} world so many {people} besides {mathematician}s {research} {and} use mathematics
Today some {mathematics} {be} {need} {in} many jobs
People working {in} {business} {science} {engineering} {and} {construction} {need} some {knowledge} {of} mathematics
{Mathematics} {solution} {problem} by using {logic}
One {of} {the} main {tool} {of} {logic} used by {mathematician} {be} {Deductive reasoning}
Deduction {be} {a} special way {of} {thought} {to} discover {and} prove {new} {truth} using {old} truths
To {a} mathematician {the} reason something {be} {true} called {a} {Proof mathematics} {be} just {as} important {as} {the} {fact} that it {be} true {and} this reason {be} often found using deduction
Using {Deductive reasoning} {be} what makes {mathematics} {thought} {different} from other {kind} {of} {Science} thinking which might rely on {Experiment} or on {Interview}
Logic {and} reasoning {be} used by {mathematician} {to} {create} {general} {rule}s which {be} {a} important part {of} mathematics
These {rule} leave {out} {information} that {be} {not} important so that {a} single {rule} can {cover} many situations

A {leap year} {be} {a} {year} {in} which {a} extra {day} {be} added {to} {the} {Gregorian calendar} which {be} used by most {of} {the} world
While {a} ordinary {year} has 365 {day}s {a} {leap year} has 366 days
The extra day {February 29} {be} added {to} {the} {month} {of} {February}
In {a} ordinary year {February} has {1 E11 m} days but {in} {a} leap year it has 29 days
The extra day called {a} leap day {be} {the} same {day} {of} {the} {week} {as} {the} first {day} {of} {the} month {February 1}
Also {in} {a} leap year {the} {month} {of} {January} {April} {and} {July} all {start} on {the} same {day} {of} {the} week
A {leap year} comes once every four years
Because {of} this {a} {leap year} can always {be} evenly {Division mathematics} by four
For example {2016} {be} {a} leap year
But {a} {year} {be} rather {a} {common year} {if} it can {be} evenly {Division mathematics} by 100 but {not} by 400
This {be} why {1600} {2000} {and} {2400} {be} leap years but {1700} {1800} {and} {1900} {be} rather {Common year} years
We have {Leap year} because instead {of} 365 days {the} {Earth} really takes {a} few {minute} less than 36514 {day} 36524219 {to} {go} completely around {the} {Sun}
Without leap years {the} {season}s would {start} {one} {day} earlier on {the} {calendar} every four years
After 360 years {spring} {in} {the} {Northern Hemisphere} {and} {autumn} {in} {the} {Southern Hemisphere} which usually begins on {March} 21 would begin on {December 21} which {be} when {winter} {in} {the} {Northern Hemisphere} {and} {summer} {in} {the} {Southern Hemisphere} presently begins

{Music} {be} also {a} {form} {of} {entertainment} that puts {sound}s together {in} {a} way that {people} like find interesting or {dance} to
Most {music} includes {people} {singing} with their {voice} or {play} {musical instrument}s such {as} {the} {piano} {guitar} {drum}s or violin
The {word} {music} comes from {the} {Greek language} {word} mousike which means art {of} {the} Muses
In {Ancient Greece} {the} {Muse}s included {the} {god}desses {of} music {poetry} {art} {and} {dance}
Someone who makes {music} {be} known {as} {a} {musician}
{Music} {be} {sound} that has {be} {organisation} by using {rhythm} {melody} or {harmony}
If someone bangs saucepans while {cooking} it makes noise
If {a} {person} bangs saucepans or {pot} {in} {a} rhythmic way they {be} making {a} {simple} type {of} music
There {be} four things which {music} has most {of} {the} time 
{Music} often has {pitch music}
This means high {and} low {note music}
{Tune}s {be} made {of} {note music} that {go} {up} or {down} or stay on {the} same pitch

This means whether it {be} quiet or loud or somewhere {in} between 
{Music} often has {timbre}
This {be} {a} {French language} {word} pronounced {the} {French language} way TAMbr
The timbre {of} {a} {sound} {be} {the} way that {a} {sound} {be} interesting
The {sort} {of} {sound} might {be} harsh gentle dry warm or something else
Timbre {be} what makes {a} {clarinet} {sound} {different} from {a} {oboe} {and} what makes {one} persons {voice} {sound} {different} from another person
There {be} {no} {simple} {definition} {of} {music} which {cover} all cases
It {be} {a} {art} form {and} {opinion}s come into play
{Music} {be} whatever {people} think {be} music
A {different} approach {be} {to} {list} {the} {quality} {music} must have such as {sound} which has rhythm melody pitch timbre {Et cetera}  These {and} other attempts do {not} {capture} all aspects {of} music or leave {out} {example} which definitely {be} music
According {to} {Robin Thomas mathematician} Clifton {music} {be} a certain reciprocal {relation} established between {a} person his {behavior} {and} {a} sounding object
Musical {experience} {and} {the} music together {be} called {phenomenon} {and} {the} activity {of} describing {phenomenon} {be} called {phenomenology}
{Amun} Tomb {of}  Nakht 18th Dynasty Western {Thebes Egypt}  Even {in} {the} {stone age} {people} made music
{2017 Westminster attack} {music} {be} probably made trying {to} imitate {sound} {and} {rhythm} that occurred naturally
{Human} {music} {may} echo these {phenomenon} using {pattern}s {repetition} {and} {tonality}
This {kind} {of} {music} {be} {still} here today
{Shamanism} sometimes imitate {sound} that {be} heard {in} {nature}
It {may} also serve {as} {entertainment} games or have practical uses {like} {Attraction} {animals} when {hunting} indicating that {the} {Neanderthal} had language because {the} hyoid {support} {the} {voice} {box} {in} {the} {human} throat
Most likely {the} first {rhythm} {instrument} or {percussion instruments} involved {the} {clapping} {of} hands {stone} hit together or other things that {be} useful {to} keep {a} beat
There {be} finds {of} this type that date {back} {to} {the} {paleolithic}
Some {of} these {be} ambiguous {as} they can {be} used either {as} {a} {tool} or {a} musical instrument
The {old} {flute} ever discovered {may} {be} {the} socalled  {Divje Babe flute} found {in} {the} {Slovenia}n {cave} Divje Babe {I} {in} 1995
It {be} {not} certain that {the} {Object grammar} {be} really {a} flute
The item {in} {question} {be} {a} fragment {of} {the} {femur} {of} {a} young {cave} {bear} {and} has {be} dated {to} about 43000 {year} ago
However whether it {be} truly {a} {musical instrument} or simply {a} carnivorechewed {bone} {be} {a} {matter} {of} ongoing debate
The fiveholed {flute} has {a} Vshaped mouthpiece {and} {be} made from {a} {vulture} {wing} bone
The researchers involved {in} {the} {discovery} officially published their findings {in} {the} journal Nature {in} {June} 2009
The {discovery} {be} also {the} {old} confirmed find {of} any {musical instrument} {in} history
Other {flute} {be} also found {in} {the} cave
This  {flute} {be} found next {to} {the} {Venus of Hohle Fels} {and} {a} {short} {distance} from {the} {old} known {human} carving
When they announced their discovery {the} {scientists} suggested that {the} finds demonstrate {the} presence {of} {a} wellestablished musical tradition at {the} {time} when modern {humans} colonized Europe
The {old} known wooden {pipe} {be} discovered {near} {Greystones} {Republic of Ireland} {in} 2004
A woodlined pit contained {a} {group} {of} six {flute} made from {yew} wood between 30 {and} 50cm long tapered at {one} end but without any {finger} holes
They {may} once have {be} strapped together
In {1986} several {bone} {flute} {be} found {in} {Jiahu} {in} {Henan} Province China
They date {to} about 6000 BC
They have between 5 {and} 8 {hole} each {and} {be} made from {the} hollow {Bone} {of} {a} bird {the} {Redcrowned Crane}
At {the} {time} {of} {the} discovery {one} {be} found {to be} {still} playable
The {bone} {flute} {Play theatre} both {the} five or sevennote {scale} {of} {Xia Zhi} {and} sixnote {scale} {of} {Qing Shang} {of} {the} {Ancient history} {Chinese musical system}
It {be} {not} known what {the} earliest {music} {of} {the} {cave} {people} {be} like
Some {architecture} {even} some {painting}s {be} {thousand} {of} {year} old but {old} {music} could {not} {survive} until {people} learned {to} {write} it down
The only way we can guess about early {music} {be} by looking at very {old} {painting} that show {people} {play} musical instruments or by finding them {in} {archaeology} digs digging underground {to} find {old} things
The earliest piece {of} {music} that {be} ever {write} {down} {and} that has {not} {be} lost {be} discovered on {a} tablet {write} {in} {Hurrians} {a} {language} spoken {in} {and} around northern {Mesopotamia} where {Iraq} {be} today from about 1500 BC
The {Oxford} Companion {to} Music ed
Percy Scholes {London} {1970}   Another early piece {of} {write} {music} that has {survive} {be} {a} {round music} called {Sumer Is Icumen In}
It {be} {write} {down} by {a} {monk} around {the} {year} 1250
Much {of} {the} {music} {in} {the} {Middle Ages} roughly 4501420 {be} {folk music} {play} by working {people} who {want} {to} sing or dance
When {people} {play} instruments they {be} usually {play} for dancers
However most {of} {the} {music} that {be} {write} {down} {be} for {the} {Roman Catholic}
This {music} {be} {write} for {monk} {to} sing {in} church
It {be} called Chant or {Gregorian chant}
In {the} {Renaissance} roughly 14001550 there {be} {a} lot {of} music {and} many {composer} {write} {music} that has {survive} so that it can {be} performed {play} or sung today
The {name} for this period Renaissance {be} {a} {French language} {word} which means rebirth
This period {be} called {the} rebirth because many {new} types {of} {art} {and} {music} {be} {birth} during this time
Some very {Beauty} {music} {be} {write} for use {in} {church} {service economics} sacred music by {the} {Italian language} {composer} {Giovanni da Palestrina} 15251594
In Palestrinas music many {Australian music} sing together this {be} called {a} {Choir music}
There {be} also plenty {of} {music} {not} {write} for {the} church such {as} {happy} {dance music} {and} romantic {love} songs
Popular {instrument} during {the} {Renaissance} included {the} {viol}s a {string instrument} {play} with {a} {bow music} {lute}s a plucked {stringed instrument} that {be} {a} {little} {like} {a} {guitar} {and} {the} {virginal} {a} small quiet {keyboard instrument}
In {the} arts {the} Baroque {be} {a} Western {cultural} era which began {near} {the} turn {of} {the} {17th century} {in} Rome
It {be} exemplified by {drama} {and} grandeur {in} sculpture painting literature dance {and} music
In music {the} {term} Baroque applies {to} {the} final period {of} dominance {of} imitative counterpoint where {different} {voice} {and} {instrument} echo each other but at {different} pitches sometimes inverting {the} echo {and} {even} reversing thematic material
The popularity {and} success {of} {the} Baroque style {be} encouraged by {the} {Roman Catholic Church} which had decided at {the} {time} {of} {the} {Honolulu City Council} {of} Trent that {the} {art} should {communication} religious themes {in} direct {and} emotional involvement
The upper {class biology} also saw {the} dramatic style {of} Baroque {architecture} {and} {art} {as} {a} means {of} impressing visitors {and} expressing triumphant {power} {and} control
Baroque {palace} {be} built around {a} entrance {of} courts grand staircases {and} reception rooms {of} sequentially increasing opulence
In similar profusions {of} detail art music architecture {and} {literature} inspired each other {in} {the} Baroque {cultural} movement {as} {artist} explored what they could {create} from repeated {and} varied patterns
Some traits {and} aspects {of} Baroque {painting} that differentiate this style from {Ethnic groups in Afghanistan} {be} {the} abundant {amount} {of} details often bright polychromy less realistic {face} {of} subjects {and} {a} overall {sense} {of} awe which {be} {one} {of} {the} goals {in} Baroque art
The {word} baroque probably derives from {the} {Ancient history} {Portuguese language} {noun} barroco which {be} {a} {pearl} that {be} {not} {round} but {of} unpredictable {and} elaborate shape
