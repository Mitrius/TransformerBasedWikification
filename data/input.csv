Classical Architecture was very formal and it always obeyed laws It used symmetry which really means and it used proportion which means keeping shapes in certain ways The Golden ratio was a rule which said if you are making a room or any other thing it will work best if you always make the long side 1 6 times longer than the short side There are many laws in Classical Architecture like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be These laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Laws 0 0 Symmetry 0 0 0 0 0 0 Proportion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Golden_ratio 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bridge 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Years 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Later people in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture then Gothic architecture Gothic buildings have tall pointed windows and arches Many churches have Gothic architecture Castles were also built at this time In Eastern Europe churches usually had domes People added their own ideas and decoration to the Classical Architecture of the past The Renaissance brought a return to classical ideas,0 0 0 Western_Europe 0 0 Middle_Ages 0 Romanesque_architecture 0 Gothic_Architecture 0 0 0 0 0 Windows 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Eastern_Europe 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Renaissance 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the late 18th century with the Industrial Revolution people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply Many factory and Mill  were built during or after this revolution Decades later in the Victorian era architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style to build new churches Up to this point buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller For example the cathedral in Ulm Germany is over 500 feet tall However building with stone has its limits and building too tall could result in collapse This happened to the Beauvais Cathedral which was never completed,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Industrial_Revolution 0 0 0 Invent 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Factory 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Victorian_era 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Masonry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ulm 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Beauvais_Cathedral 0 0 0 0
Towards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution steel became much cheaper Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris Buildings can now be built taller than ever before We call them skyscrapers This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated replaced or abandoned Cheap strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls especially for office buildings,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Steel 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Eiffel_Tower 0 Paris 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Skyscrapers 0 0 Technology 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In 2002 the club s owners decided that they wanted to move the club out of London Nobody really knows why they wanted to move They said that there were too many clubs in London that not enough people were coming to watch the matches This meant that they did not collect enough money at the gate to pay everyone and that is why they could not afford to stay They looked at Cardiff and Dublin before deciding to move to Milton Keynes Milton Keynes is a new city that is 45 miles north of London When they said what they wanted to do most of their fans stopped paying to see matches which meant that they had even less money to pay everyone,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cardiff 0 Dublin 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Before the move could happen they had to get permission from the Football Association The FA is the association of all the football clubs in England The clubs elect a Committee to decide what to do about things Most things they have to decide are easy but this was not easy to decide Or maybe they knew what to decide but did not want to be the ones to decide it So they asked three clever men to study the problem and tell them what would be best to do These three men said that the club should be allowed to move,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Football_Association 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some members of the Committee did not like this decision and tried to stop it But the owners of Wimbledon F C said that they would get a judge to decide if anyone tried to stop them It costs a lot of money to go to court and whoever loses has to pay for everybody The other clubs would not agree to pay if this happened so the FA had to disagree the move,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Judge 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

But the boycott continued In 2006 the Football Fans Federation proposed a way forward The most important thing for the town of Wimbledon  London was the trophies that the club had won when it was called Wimbledon F C The agreement was that Milton Keynes Dons F C would give these trophies to Merton Borough Council which is the local government area that contains Wimbledon The league history of Milton Keynes Dons F C would start from 2004 which is when they changed their name The Fans Federation would ask fans to end the boycott Everybody agreed and this is what has happened,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Wimbledon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Now this spaceship happens to be going very fast It is not coming to Earth to visit but it does happen to fly over the North Pole There is a science station with a telescope at the North Pole They see a flash from the clock on the space ship and then they see another flash Only the flashes do not come a second apart They come at a slower rate The reason is that the situation is like the basketball player on the airplane The ball is pushed downward by the player s hand That is the light in the spaceship s machine firing off a burst toward the mirror The ball hits the floor and bounces That is like the light hitting the mirror and being reflected The ball returns to the player s hand That is like the light hitting the machine and triggering a new burst of light Note that the distance between the place on the ground where the basketball is seen to hit the floor and the distance on the ground where the basketball is seen to return to the basketball player s hand is some great distance Depending on how fast the plane is going it might be a kilometer or even a mile away,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Mass not weight can be transformed into energy Another way of expressing this idea is to say that matter can be transformed into energy Units of mass are used to measure the amount of matter in something The mass or the amount of matter in something determines how much energy that thing could be changed into,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Energy can also be transformed into mass If you were pushing a baby buggy at a slow walk and found it easy to push but pushed it at a fast walk and found it harder to move then you would wonder what was wrong with the baby buggy Then if you tried to run and found that moving the buggy at any faster speed was like pushing against a brick wall you would be very surprised The truth is that when something is moved then its mass is increased Human beings ordinarily do not notice this increase in mass because at the speed humans ordinarily move the increase in mass in almost nothing,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
As speeds get closer to the speed of light then the changes in mass become impossible not to notice The basic experience we all share in daily life is that the harder we push something like a car the faster we can get it going But when something we are pushing is already going at some large part of the speed of light we find that it keeps gaining mass so it gets harder and harder to get it going faster It is impossible to make any mass go at the speed of light because to do so would take infinity energy,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infinity 0
Sometimes a mass will change to energy Common examples of elements that make these changes we call radioactivity are radium and uranium An atom of uranium can lose an alpha particle and become a new element with a lighter nucleus Then that atom will emit two electrons but it will not be stable yet It will emit a series of alpha particles and electrons until it finally becomes the element Pb or what we call lead By throwing out all these particles that have mass it has made its own mass smaller It has also produced energy George Gamow One Two Three Infinity p 170ff,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Radioactivity 0 Radium 0 Uranium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The Georgian survivors did not have a happy ending They were sent back to the Soviet Union Stalin said that because the soldiers had been captured by the Germans they had not fought until they died so they were traitors Some of the two million Soviet prisoners who were sent back to the Soviet Union by the Allied forces after the end of the war were executed when they got there,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Soviet_Union Stalin 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

One may say that homosexuality is the term used for people that feel romantically or sexual attraction attracted to their own sex but other definitions also exist When one views homosexuality as the term for people that feel romantically or sexually attracted to their own sex more people are gay than when one might view homosexuality as only a term for people who do have sexual relationships with their own sex Usually the term is used to view all the people who are romantically or sexually attracted to their own sex as well as those with such attractions who have not had a sexual relationship with their own sex yet Nonetheless the most visible form of homosexuality is the actual relationship Most evidence of homosexuality in ancient cultures comes from drawings of the men in an intimate relationship or sex because it s the most obvious,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The causes of homosexuality and bisexuality are controversial Some people see homosexuality and bisexuality as a choice that a person makes However many modern scientists have theorized that homosexuality is not a choice The causes of homosexuality are not all understood but genetics and the effects of prenatal hormones and environment are sometimes thought to be causes Scientists also show that homosexuality happens not only in humans Some animals often show homosexuality some even for lifelong periods as is the case with humans,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Genetics 0 0 0 0 0 Hormones 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Doctors used to treat gay people as if they had mental illnesses However homosexuality is no longer called a disease by doctors in many countries There are some religious and non religious groups who still try to cure homosexuality This is sometimes called conversion therapy In therapies like this one homosexual individuals have tried to change themselves to heterosexual and have even claimed they were changed but most people do not believe it is possible,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Conversion therapy or reparative therapy aims to change sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual It is condemned by medical and psychiatry groups such as the American Psychological Association American Psychiatric Association Royal College of Psychiatrists National Association of Social Workers Royal College of Nursing and the American Academy of Pediatrics These scientific and educated groups are concerned that such therapy is a violation of the ethical principles of health care and violates human rights,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Many people believe that it is unfortunate to discuss causes of homosexuality and bisexuality without discussing causes of heterosexuality too Although it is easy to understand why heterosexuality exists that does not explain how the brain develops to produce heterosexual people Heterosexuality homosexuality and bisexuality all have causes and some people believe that to discuss only the causes of homosexuality and bisexuality suggests that there is something wrong with people who have those orientations,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Gay people can fall in love and have lifelong relationships In most countries they cannot legally marry their partners However they still have relationships in the same way as heterosexual people They often call each other partners or life partners instead of spouse husband or wife Instead of having a marriage ceremony they may have a commitment ceremony,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A want is a wish or a for something If a person would like to have something but can choose not to have it that thing is wanted or can be called a want To want is not the same as to need which is when someone must have something,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Need 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
People often talk about needing a thing when they really just want it Wants can be for the same things as needs For example a person can need to eat food and can want to eat cake If there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else perhaps bread The need is no longer so important although the want may still be there If there is cake then the person s needs and wants can both be met,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Cattle are found all over the world from as far north as Canada and Russia to the dry inland of Australia The only continent they are not found on is Antarctica Different types and breeds of cattle are suited to different environments Bos indicus cattle such as the Brahman breed are suited to subtropical and tropical areas whereas Bos taurus cattle such as Angus cattle are more suited to temperate or colder climates Their large wide hooves are good in both wet areas and dry grassland Their hairy coat grows much longer in the winter and has an extra fluffy layer to hold in warmth They shed this extra layer in springtime in preparation for the hot summer ahead Most cattle except those of the Bos indicus subspecies do not have sweat glands in their skin but their wet nose is a useful cooling system They can also pant like a dog as well,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Environments 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Subtropical 0 Tropical 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Grassland 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
For the reasons above most male cattle are either sent to slaughter while they are still calves or are castrated so that they are much less likely to fight each other or be aggressive towards the farmer that is raising them making them safer to handle and keep until it is time to send them to market Steers have no other purpose except to be raised sold and slaughtered for beef,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Cattle are very useful animals Their flesh can be eaten as meat Their milk can be drunk and turned into cheese and yogurt Their skin can be used as leather They can pull carts and plows They can make the power to turn flour mills or pump water The food that they eat is not expensive and often not in competition with what people eat,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A number of dairy herds are kept in barns or sheds for most of their lives and are given feed that has been especially made for them This feed contains grain like corn hay including grass and alfalfa or clover and fermented chopped feed called silage that is usually made from corn wheat or barley Cows are often kept in stalls where they have enough room to lay down comfortably Such large dairies must supply straw or saw dust for the cows to rest on without getting sore from the hard concrete floor,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Cows can be milked by hand but in many countries where there are large dairies the cows are milked by a milking machine The milk is collected in a large stainless steel container where it undergoes pastuerization a process that heats milk to a very high temperature to kill any bacteria that are living in the milk The milk is then taken by truck to a milk or dairy factory to be made into the milk we drink by being separated to remove most of the cream It is then put into bottles or cartons to be sold Some milk is also turned into cheese ice cream butter cream and even yogurt All of these dairy products are packaged or put into cartons or bottles and sold,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cheese Ice_Cream Butter Cream 0 0 Yogurt 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Until the mid 20th century beef cattle were often sent to market on the hoof Cowboys or droving would herd the cattle along the roads or on trails to the cattle markets in big towns or cities or to railway stations where they would be loaded and shipped to these towns or cities In Australia sometimes the cattle would travel for hundreds of miles along roads known as Traveling Stock Routes Big herds would have thousands of heads of cattle Nowadays cattle are usually sent to the market in huge lorries known as road trains In North America cattle are sent to auction marts slaughter plants or other farms or ranches by large semi trucks called cattle liners,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cowboys 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Oxen are most often used in teams of two for light work such as plowing In past days very large teams of fourteen to twenty oxen were used for heavy work such as logging The oxen are put into pairs and each pair must work together A wooden yoke is put about the neck of each pair so that the work is shared across their shoulders Oxen are chosen from certain breeds with horns since the horns hold the yoke in place when the oxen lower their heads back up or slow down,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A mistaken idea about cattle is that they become angry when they see the color red This is not correct Cattle cannot see red because they do not have red receptors in their eyes They can however see colors such as blue yellow and green because they have yellow and blue receptors in their eyes This mistake comes from seeing Matadors or bull fighters using a red cape to encourage a bull to charge at them But really red is a color that is only used as part of Spanish tradition and culture It is also a way to make the matador more visible from the crowd and enables people in the crowd to easily see what is going on and also as a way to excite them Thus it is merely the motion of the cape that makes a bull charge not the colour An angry bull or bull that is threatening you will charge if you move or if something no matter the color is waved in front of his face,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Colors 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tradition 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In Aztec society there were different social classes with different social statuses The most important people were the rulers The Aztecs first king was Acamapichtli Their last king was Cuauhtemoc He surrender  control of the Aztec Empire to Hernan Cortes during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire Macdonald Fiona The Aztec and Mayan Worlds The Rosen Publishing Group p 60,0 0 Society 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hernan_Cortes 0 0 Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The next social class was the commoners These were the Empire s everyday workers Most of them farmer ran stores or traded Other workers included artisans regular soldiers and fisherman Commoners were allowed to own land as a group or a family However a single person was not allowed to own land,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Farmer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Soldiers 0 Fisherman 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This widely accepted model known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg Immanuel Kant and Pierre Simon Laplace Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy physics geology and planetary science As our knowledge of space has grown the models have been changed to account for the new observations,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hypothesis 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Emanuel_Swedenborg Immanuel_Kant 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Astronomy Physics Geology 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets while other moons are believed to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets Still others as the Earth s Moon may be the result of Giant impact hypothesiss,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earth 0 Moon 0 0 0 0 0 0
Many collisions between bodies have occurred and have been important to the evolution of the Solar System The positions of the planets often shifted and planets have switched places This planetary migration is thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System s early evolution,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The Earth s orbit around the Sun is nearly a perfect circle but when mapped it is found that the Earth moves around the Sun in a very slightly oval shaped called an orbit The other planets in the Solar System also circle the Sun in slightly elliptical orbits Mercury  has a more elliptical orbit than the others and some of the smaller objects orbit the Sun in very orbit,0 Earth 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earth 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Orbit 0 0 Planets 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Orbit
The planets are the biggest objects that go around Sun It took people many years of using telescopes to find the objects that were farthest away Planets beyond Neptune might still be found and more small objects are found every year Most of the planets have Satellite  that orbit around them just as the planets orbit the Sun There are at least 173 of these moons in the solar system,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Telescopes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Planets_beyond_Neptune 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Pluto had been called a planet since it was discovered in 1930 but in 2006 astronomers meeting at the International Astronomical Union decided on the definition of a planet and Pluto did not fit Instead they defined a new category of dwarf planet into which Pluto did fit along with some others These small planets are sometimes called plutinos,Pluto 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Astronomers 0 0 0 International_Astronomical_Union 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dwarf_Planet 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The first four planets closest to the Sun are called the inner planets They are small and dense terrestrial planets with solid surfaces They are made up of mostly rock and metal with a distinct internal structure and a similar size Three also have an atmosphere The study of the four planets gives information about geology outside the Earth Most asteroids are also often counted with the inner planets,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Atmosphere 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Geology 0 0 0 0 Asteroids 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Some theories of economics say ethics has to do with money Money is a big part of most people s lives Thinking about morality can be important in economics For example there is a saying about ethics taken from the Bible that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil The philosophy of Marxism also says that a few people using money in the wrong way can hurt many other people,0 0 0 Economics 0 0 0 0 0 0 Money 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bible 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Evil 0 0 0 Marxism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In work thinking about ethics can help with hard questions Work can be like both economics and politics Workers have to make money and follow laws But the best way to do both is not always easy to know The study of this is called business ethics,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
People like Medical doctor and nurses have to make choices about how to health care for people Sometimes the person being cared for their family or the doctor do not agree what is best for them Also choices have to be made if there are enough resources to help all The study of this is called medical ethics Similar studies for specific professions include bioethics and legal ethics,0 0 Medical_doctor 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Family 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bioethics 0 0
Discussing ethics can also be a way to stop people fighting or starting a war By talking about ethics people hope to get what they want without being violent This works when all people agree that peace is very important But not everyone agrees about what is right or wrong So sometimes anger can make it hard to talk without fighting,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

To talk about the shape of the Universe scientists want to forget that the Universe is expanding So they separate the shape from time and pretend that the Universe is not expanding They remember that really the Universe is expanding but they write this in a variable called the scale factor Then the distances they talk about while putting the scale factor to the side are called comoving distances When they think about the Universe using comoving distance they think of the Universe as not expanding This way some calculations are easier,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Scientists 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Time 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Variable 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The South Pole is hard to reach Unlike the North pole which is covered by the sea and flat sea ice the South Pole is on a mountainous continent This continent is called Antarctica It is covered by thick ice The south Pole is very high up and is very windy It is far from places where people live and ships going there often have to find their way through thick sea ice Once ashore land travelling explorers have to travel more than a thousand miles to get to the pole They must cross a floating ice shelf then up onto the ice covered land up steep mountain glaciers covered in broken twisted ice slowly sliding to the sea and across a high level land covered in ice and swept by strong freezing winds,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Continent 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Two expeditions early in the 20th century led by Robert Falcon Scott and then Ernest Shackleton failed to reach the South Pole but returned safely Shackleton turned back quite close to the pole but it was late in the season and supplies were low He knew that he would be risking the lives of his men so he turned back,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Robert_Falcon_Scott 0 0 Ernest_Shackleton 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The most famous South Pole expedition is perhaps the one that failed badly This was the British expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott Scott and four other men dragging their equipment on sledges had hoped to be first to the Pole When they arrived they saw a Norwegian flag A letter left for Scott showed that Amundsen and his men had beaten them by a month by using dogs to pull their sledges,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 British 0 0 0 Robert_Falcon_Scott 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Detailed observations of the location of Mars were made by Babylonian who developed methods using math to predict the future position of the planet The ancient Ancient Greece and astronomers developed a model of the solar system with the Earth at the center instead of the sun They used this model to explain the planet s motions Indian and Islamic astronomers estimated the size of Mars and its distance from Earth Similar work was done by Chinese people astronomers,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Babylonian 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancient_Greece 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Indian 0 Islamic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chinese_people 0

During the 1877 opposition Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli used a telescope to help produce the first detailed map of Mars What caught people s attention was that the maps had features he called canali These were later shown to be an optical illusion These canali were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth His term canali was popularly mistranslated in English as canals and thought to be made by intelligent beings,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Canals 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Photography is a way of making a picture using a camera A person who makes pictures using a camera is called a photographer A picture made using a camera is called a photograph or photo,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Picture 0 0 Camera 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Photographer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The photograph in a camera may be made on film or if it is a digital camera using an electronics sensor,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electronics 0
The picture the lens makes is recorded on photographic film Film is placed inside the camera box Light coming through the lens aperture and open shutter shines on the film Photographic film is coated with chemicals that react when light shines on it Letting light shine on the film is called exposing the film,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Another difference between films is how sensitive they are to light Films have a code number called an ISO number The number tells how fast a film reacts when light shines on it,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Once the film has been exposed it is processed Processing has to be done in total darkness or the film will be exposed too much and the picture will be lost Processing stops the film reacting to light any more After the film has been processed the picture can be seen on the film,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Digital photography uses a digital camera Sometimes it is called digital imaging Like other cameras a digital camera has a lens aperture and Shutter  The picture the lens makes is recorded by a light sensitive Electronics sensor A digital camera does not use photographic film to record a picture Digital photographs are stored in storage devices such as SD cards They can later be transferred to a computer Paper prints can also be made from digital pictures Digital cameras are also not expensive to use as there is no film to buy,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electronics Sensor 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
One of the most important things when taking a photograph is focusing the lens If the lens is not focused well the photograph will be blurry Autofocus cameras focus automatically when the shutter release is pressed There are also manual focus cameras,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Autofocus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This is explained by the idea of retrogradation Like all planets and asteroids in the Solar System beyond Earth Neptune goes through retrogradation at certain points during its Orbital period In addition to the start of retrogradation other events inside the synodic period include astronomical opposition the return to prograde and retrograde motion and Conjunction  to the Sun,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Retrogradation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Retrogradation 0 0 0 0 0 Orbital_period 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Neptune turned out to have the strongest winds of all the solar system s gas giants In the outer regions of the solar system where the Sun shines over 1000 times fainter than on Earth the last of the four giants did happen as what the scientists actually expected One might think that the farther a planet is from the Sun the less energy and heat there would be to create and run the very strong winds around The winds on Jupiter were already hundreds of kilometres per hour Rather than seeing slower winds the scientists found faster winds on more distant Neptune,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Jupiter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
One possible guess for the cause of the faster wind speeds is that if enough energy is produced turbulence is created which slows the winds down At Neptune however there is so little solar energy that once winds are started they meet very little resistance and are able to keep very high speeds Anyhow Neptune gives out more energy than it gets from the Sun and the internal energy source of these winds remains undetermined,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Turbulence 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The brain does the thinking learning and feeling for the body For humans it is the source of consciousness We do not know whether other mammals have consciousness The brain also controls basic autonomic body actions like breathing digestion heartbeat that happen automatically These activities and much else are governed by unconscious functions of the brain and nervous system All the information about the world gathered by our senses is sent through nerves into the brain allowing us to see hear smell taste and feel things The brain processes this information and we experience it as pictures sounds and so on The brain also uses nerves to tell the body what to do for example by telling muscles to move or our heart to beat faster,0 0 0 0 Thinking 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Consciousness 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Autonomic 0 0 0 Breathing Digestion Heartbeat 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Unconscious 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Senses 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Heart 0 0 0

To understand M theory one must first have some knowledge of string theory For hundreds of years scientists have thought that the simplest objects in the universe are points like dots String theory says that this is wrong and that the simplest objects in the universe are shaped like pieces of string These strings are so small that even when looked at very closely they look like points Each basic particle is created by the strings vibration in different patterns The reason scientists had not thought of this idea for so long is that strings are much harder to work with than points They seem to break such rules as causality and special relativity which says that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Scientists 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Universe 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vibration 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Causality 0 Special_Relativity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Another problem with string theory is that there are 5 different versions of it Each version allows different kinds of strings and says they work in different ways String theory is supposed to be a theory of everything so there should be only one version not 5 M theory solves this problem,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In 1995 Edward Witten started what has been called the Second Superstring Revolution by introducing M theory to the world This theory combines the 5 different string theories into one theory What Witten actually did was to predict that the fact that all these different theories were connected was a result of there being some underlying theory of which they were all approximations This theory is somewhat vague in nature and has not yet been pinned down,0 1995 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Additionally it was found that the equations that required string theory to exist in 10 dimensions were actually approximations as well The proposed M theory would need one extra dimension and instead be a theory that takes place in 11 dimensions Witten has himself compared this idea in simple terms to a general who takes up a position on a hilltop the extra space coordinate to get a better view of the battlefield s two other dimensions,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Summer is one of the four seasons It is the heat season of the year In some places summer is the wettest season and in other places it is a dry season Four seasons are found in areas which are not too hot or too cold Summer happens to the north and south sides of the Earth at opposite times of the year In the north part of the world summer takes place between the months of June and September and in the south part of the world it takes place between December and March This is because when the north part of the Earth points towards the Sun the south part points away Many people in rich countries travel in summer to seaside resorts beaches camps or picnics In some countries they celebrate things in the summer as well as enjoying cool drinks Other countries get snow in the summer just like winter In USA summer is cool The temperature rises up in summer There are holidays in summer Many people enjoy summer,0 0 0 0 0 0 Seasons 0 0 0 Heat 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cold 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earth 0 0 0 0 0 Year 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 June 0 September 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 December 0 March 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Travel 0 0 0 0 Beaches 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Minarchism are libertarians who believe that society should have a state with very limited power They believe that free markets are the most moral and efficient way of providing goods and services They typically believe that the only things the state should provide are police and judges to make sure that people obey the laws and a military to make sure that no one attacks the country Some minarchists believe in having a small amount of taxation and limited provision of public goods such as international diplomacy and public parks,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Police 0 Judges 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Military 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Diplomacy 0 0 0

It was dug in the early 1970s and it showed many times that people lived there The first was in the early Neolithic when the hill seems to have been an important place for groups of early agriculture who moved around Most things were found from when late Bronze Age people lived on the hill In the Iron Age the site changed with many big walls There are signs that when the Romans came to Britain they killed many people here Ruins of a feasting hall built after the Roman time were also found in the dig There are also legends connecting this place with King Arthur,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Neolithic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Agriculture 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bronze_Age 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Iron_Age 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 King_Arthur
Many animals develop in separate stages A larva develops from the egg  in those animals It is a separate life stage from the adult reproductive stage A larva does not look like the adult animal and changes shape as it grows up There may be several larval stages before the adult form Tadpoles maggots and caterpillars are larvae,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Animals 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Adult 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Adult 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tadpoles 0 0 Caterpillars 0 0
Ocean organisms with a larval stage often release large numbers of ovum and sperms into the water column After fertilisation the eggs develop into tiny larvae The larvae develop and grow for some time before metamorphosing into adults Most marine invertebrates and many fish have a pelagic larval stage or pelagic eggs These live in the plankton and may be transported long distances,Ocean 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ovum 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fertilisation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Invertebrates 0 0 Fish 0 0 Pelagic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Plankton 0 0 0 0 0 0
The other consideration is the small size of the eggs If animals lay many small eggs then the young stages cannot live the life the adults lead They must live a separate life until they have the size and capability to live as an adult This is what the larvae do,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Bankruptcy is a law which happens when a person or an organisation does not have enough money to pay all of its debts Legally they are Insolvency,0 0 0 Law 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Money 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Insolvency
Where it is a person who cannot pay their debts the person s creditors may ask the court to appoint a trustee in bankruptcy This is a professional accountant who is appointed by the court and they will take control of the bankrupt person s assets Some assets are protected by law but the trustee in bankruptcy will sell off all of the other assets and use the proceeds to pay as much of that person s debts as possible After the process is complete the person is discharged from bankruptcy and the person is free from any further liability to pay those claims but normally that person will be limited in their ability to borrow money again because their credit rating will be damaged,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Where it is an organisation who cannot pay their debts the creditors may ask the court to appoint a liquidator The liquidator does a very similar job to the trustee in bankruptcy except that there are no assets which are protected so the liquidator can sell everything Once all of the assets of the organisation have been sold the organisation is then dissolved and no longer exists Organisations do not get discharged from bankruptcy in the same way that a living person does,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
People often confuse the terms bankruptcy and insolvency and sometimes they use one word when they really mean the other Insolvency usually just means that a someone does not have enough money to pay their debts or that the total amount of their debts is worth more than the total amount of their assets Bankruptcy is a formal legal process in front of the courts Although the two terms are connected just because a person is insolvent does not necessarily mean that they will go into bankruptcy,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Insolvency 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In various countries individual people can try and reach individual voluntary arrangements with their creditors This means that the creditors agree to take less money to discharge their debts There are similar processes for companies and other organisations and they go by various different names in different countries but in many countries they are called schemes of arrangement,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In many countries a company or business can ask the courts for bankruptcy protection to try and protect the business so that the creditors cannot destroy all of the physical capital and goodwill by breaking it apart and moving it away The aim of this is provide is more time for the business to reorganise itself and to work out a new deal between the owners and the people the business owes money In many countries this is called going into administration,0 0 0 0 Company 0 Business 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Time 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Often a creditor threatens a debtor with debt slavery in many parts of the world In some cases the debtor does not know that they have a right to go bankrupt This is a human rights problem in some countries Also some creditors continue to harass a debtor even though bankruptcy laws say they should not hoping that the debtor will pay them money that they do not deserve,0 0 Creditor 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When a bankruptcy case is filed a trustee is chosen by the court The trustee has authority over the property of the bankrupt person or business and may use some of the debtor s assets to pay the creditors After a bankruptcy is filed creditors are notified that they are to stop trying to collect money directly from the debtor and are to make claims for payment to the bankruptcy court,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Assets 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In general musical instruments have become louder as concert halls have become bigger Violins are louder than viols Modern violins are louder than the early 17th century violins largely because of they have metal strings instead of gut strings The piano developed from the clavichord which was very quiet indeed Woodwind instruments developed from Renaissance instruments while the clarinet was invented in the middle of the 18th century and the saxophone and tuba came even later Modern trumpets sound much brighter than the straight trumpets of the 18th century,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Metal 0 0 0 Gut 0 0 0 0 0 0 Clavichord 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Renaissance 0 0 0 Clarinet 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Saxophone 0 Tuba 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Analog signal circuits are used for signals that have a range of amplitudes In general analog circuits measure or control the amplitude of signals In the early days of electronics all electronic devices used analog circuits The frequency of the analog circuit is often measured or controlled in analog signal processing Even though more digital circuits are made analog circuits will always be necessary since the world and its people work in analog ways,Analog_signal 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Frequency 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Pulse circuits are used for signals that require rapid pulses of energy For example aircraft and ground radar equipment work by using pulse circuits to create and send high powered bursts of radio energy from radar transmitters Special antennas are used to send the high powered bursts in the direction the beam or dish antenna is pointed,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Aircraft 0 0 Radar 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The radar transmitter s pulses or bursts of radio energy hit and bounce back from hard and metallic objects Hard objects are things like buildings hills and mountains Metallic objects are anything made of metal like aircraft bridges or even objects in space like Satellite  The reflected radar energy is detected by radar pulse receivers which use both pulse and digital circuits together The pulse and digital circuits in radar pulse receivers are used to show the location and distance of objects which have reflected the radar transmitter s high powered pulses,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
By controlling how often the rapid pulses of radar energy are sent out by a radar transmitter and how long it takes for the reflected pulse energy to come back to the radar receiver one can tell not only where objects are but also how far away they are Digital circuits in a radar receiver calculate the distance to an object by knowing the time interval between energy pulses The radar receiver s digital circuits count how long it takes between pulses for an object s reflected energy to be detected by the radar receiver Since radar pulses are sent and received at approximately the speed of light the distance to an object can easily be calculated This is done in digital circuits by multiplying the speed of light by the time it takes to receive the radar energy reflected back from an object,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Digital circuits are used for signals that only turn on and off instead of often working at levels somewhere between on and off Active components in digital circuits typically have one signal level when turned on and another signal level when turned off In general in digital circuits a component is only switched on and off,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Vietnam s history has long been characterized by the neighborhood of China in the north For about 1 000 years northern Vietnam belonged to China but from 938 the country became independent and later expanded southward at the expense of the Champa kingdom In the 19th century the country was colonized by France and during the Second World War the country was occupied by Japan After this war the colonial empire did not have the resources to restore the regime and lost the military battle against the liberation forces This led to the division of the country which in turn led to the Vietnam War with major human and material losses for the country The war ended on April 30 1975 by the fact that North Vietnam took the southern part After experimental planning in the 1970s and 1980s the economy was reformed in a market economy direction,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 China 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 China 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 France 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 North_Vietnam 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
About 5000 years ago the two ethnic tribes of the Lac Viet and Au Viet lived together in many areas with other inhabitants Due to increasing needs to control floods fights against invaders and culture and trade exchanges these tribes living near each other tended to gather together and integrate into a larger mixed group,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Swimming for long periods needs oxygen for the red fibres The oxygen supply has to be constant because these fibres only operate aerobically They are red because they have a rich blood supply and they contain myoglobin Myoglobin transports the oxygen to the oxidising systems Red muscle gets its energy by oxidising fat which weight for weight has twice as much energy as carbohydrate or protein Using their red fibres fish can keep up a speed of 35 lengths per second for long periods,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Myoglobin 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fat 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Caesar had four documented episodes of what may have been complex partial seizures He may additionally have had absence seizures in his youth The earliest accounts of these seizures were made by the biographer Suetonius who was born after Caesar died The claim of epilepsy is countered among some medical historians by a claim of hypoglycemia This can cause seizures which are a bit like epilepsy,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Suetonius 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hypoglycemia 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A sundial shows the current solar time during the day It does this because the sun appears to move through the sky At different times in the day when the sun is shining a shadow is cast in different places on the dial A person marks the dial with the time at a certain shadow This lets users easily see the time There are a few commonly seen designs such as the ordinary or standard garden sundial However sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sun 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Shadow 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Because idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly Some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times The idiom shape up or ship out which is like saying improve your behavior or leave if you don t might be said by an employer or supervisor to an employee but not to other people,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

To learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language and how and when to use them But people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings In order to understand an idiom one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Insects are cold blooded which means that they cannot control their body temperature Although most social insects can control the temperature of their hive or nest This means that insects are not good at surviving the cold at any rate out in the open In the winter many insects go into something called diapause which is the insect version of hibernation Some insects like cockroaches cannot go into diapause and they will die if it gets too cold outside This is why cockroaches love living in people s warm houses,0 0 Cold 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Diapause 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hibernation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

After the eggs hatch two kinds of development may occur Some insects have what is called incomplete metamorphosis This means that a small insect called a nymph  comes out of the egg and the nymph looks almost the same as the adult insect As the nymph grows it does not change the way it looks but only how big it is It goes through a number of stages called instars Grasshoppers grow in this way,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Metamorphosis 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Adult 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Grasshoppers 0 0 0 0
Other insects have complete metamorphosis which means that the small larva which comes out of the egg looks very different from the adult insect Insects that have complete metamorphosis usually come out of the egg as a larva which usually looks like a worm The larva eats food and gets bigger until it turns into a pupa Butterfly pupae are often inside cocoons Inside the cocoon the insect changes the way it looks and often grows wings When the cocoon opens the adult insect comes out Many insects have complete metamorphosis for example beetles butterflies and moths and flies The adult stage of development is called the imago,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Larva 0 0 0 0 0 Worm 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pupa 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Wings 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Imago
The oldest known insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha from the 396 million year old Rhynie chert It may have superficially resembled a modern day silverfish insect This species already possessed mandibles of a type associated with winged insects suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time Thus the first insects probably appeared earlier in the Silurian period,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Devonian 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rhynie_chert 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Silverfish 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Silurian 0

The origins of insect flight remain obscure since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax for a total of three pairs It seems the insects were not a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved wings,0 0 0 0 Flight 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Therefore depending on an author s definition of writing the term may be used in different ways With many early systems we do not know what they do convey The central idea is that a full writing system must be able to represent anything that might be said in spoken language p7 217 From this point of view the invention of the rebus is an essential step A rebus is an existing symbol such as a pictogram used just for its sound to represent a word Many ancient writing systems used the rebus concept to represent abstract words which otherwise would be hard to represent by pictograms,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rebus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Writing was invented independently a number of times The Sumerian the Ancient Egyptian the China and the Maya civilization writings are separate in their invention Some authorities have suggested that Egyptian hieroglyphs arose from Sumeriam writing There is no direct evidence for this and their scripts and methods of writing are entirely different p85 All these writing systems started with pictographs symbols that stood for things Then they developed a mixture of methods Our own alphabetic system is different It is based on the sounds of speech language All alphabets are modified versions of the first one which originated with the Phoenicians and the Ancient Greeks,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancient_Egyptian 0 China 0 0 Maya_civilization 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Speech 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Phoenicians 0 0 Ancient_Greeks

Many other birds are very brightly coloured in countless combinations Some of the most colourful birds are quite common like pheasants peacocks domestic fowl and parrots Colourful small birds include blue tits the gold finches humming birds fairy wrens and bee eaters Some birds like those of the bird of paradise in Papua New Guinea have such beautiful feathers that they have been hunted for them,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Papua_New_Guinea 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The peafowl is the best example of a display of colour to attract a mate Also the male domestic fowl and junglefowl have long shiny feathers above his tail and also long neck feathers that may be a different colour to his wings and body There are only a very few types of birds where the female is more colourful than the male,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Most birds can fly They do this by pushing through the air with their wings The curved surfaces of the wings cause air currents which lift the bird Flapping keeps the air current moving to create lift and also moves the bird forward,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some birds can glide on air currents without flapping Many birds use this method when they are about to land Some birds can also hover and remain in one place This method is used by birds of prey such as falcons that are looking for something to eat Seagulls are also good at hovering particularly if there is a strong breeze The most expert hovering birds are tiny hummingbirds which can beat their wings both backwards and forwards and can stay quite still in the air while they dip their long beaks into flowers to feed on the sweet nectar,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Falcons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nectar

Large birds of prey such as eagles that spend a lot of time soaring on the wind have wings that are large and broad The main flight feathers are long and wide They help the eagle to stay on rising air currents without using much energy while the eagle looks at the ground below to find the next meal When the eagle sees some small creature move it can close its wings and fall from the sky like a missile opening its great wings again to slow down as it comes to land The world s largest eagle the Philippine eagle has a wingspan of about 2 metres wide,0 0 0 0 0 0 Eagles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Philippine_Eagle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Birds that live in grassland areas or open forests and feed on fruit insects and reptiles often spend a lot of time flying short journeys looking for food and water They have wings that are shaped in a similar way to eagles but rounder and not as good for soaring These include many Australian birds like cockatoos,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Birds that fly very quickly such as swifts and swallows have long narrow pointed wings These birds need great speed because they eat insects catching most of them while they are flying These birds also migrate They often collect in huge flocks of thousands of birds that move together like a whirling cloud,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Swifts 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Birds that live in bushes and branches have triangular wings that help the bird change direction Many forest birds are expert at getting up speed by flapping and then gliding steadily among the trees tilting to avoid things as they go Members of the kingfisher family are expert at this type of flying,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Kingfisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Flocks of birds can be very highly organised in a way that takes care of all the flock members Studies of small flocking birds like tree sparrows show that they clearly communicate with each other as sometimes thousands of birds may fly in close formation and spiral patterns without colliding,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Spiral 0 0 0
Two common behaviours in flocking birds are guarding and reconnaissance When a flock of birds is feeding it is common for one bird to perch on a high place to keep guard over the flock In the same way when a flock is asleep often one bird will remain awake,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Ostriches and emus do not need to fly because although they feed and nest on the ground their great size and their speed is their protection Some other ground feeding birds have not been so lucky Some birds such as the dodo and the kiwi were ground feeding birds that lived in safety on islands where there was nothing dangerous to eat them They lost the power of flight Kiwis are endangered because European settlement to New Zealand brought animals like cats dogs and rats which kill kiwis and eat their eggs However kiwis and also the rare New Zealand ground parrot have survived In the case of dodos they were fat and delicious They were killed and eaten by sailors until there was none left Other flightless birds which have disappeared are the great auk and the moa,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dodo 0 0 Kiwi 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Kiwis 0 0 0 0 0 0 New_Zealand 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Great_Auk 0 0 Moa
Penguins spend a great deal of time at sea where they are in danger from seals On land they usually live in areas where there were few dangers until the arrival of European settlers with dogs and cats Their wings have adapted to life in the sea and have become flippers which help them in swimming very fast,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Modern birds do not have teeth but they must nevertheless break up food before it is digested First of all along their throat they have a crop This stores food items before digestion That way a bird can eat several items and then fly off to a quiet spot to digest them,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Digestion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Their stomach comes next with two very different parts One part is like a straight hollow rod which secretes mild hydrochloric acid and an enzyme to break down protein The other part of the stomach is the gizzard This is muscular and grinds up the contents In herbivorous birds the gizzard contains some gastroliths Bones of fish will mostly be dissolved by the stomach acid The partly digested and ground up food now goes to the intestine where digestion is completed and then most contents are absorbed Anything indigestible for example remains of feathers is regurgitated via the mouth not the cloaca,0 Stomach 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Enzyme 0 0 0 Protein 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gizzard 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cloaca

Humans are believed to be omnivores because they eat meat as well as vegetable matter However research has shown that humans are more suited to a herbivore or frugivore diet because of the shape and make up of our hands feet and teeth People who eat mostly plants are usually called vegetarians or Veganism,Humans 0 0 0 0 Omnivores 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vegetarians 0 Veganism

According to the theory of predator prey interactions the relationship between herbivores and plants is cyclic Gotelli N J 1995 A primer of ecology Sinauer When prey are numerous their predators increase in numbers reducing the plant population which in turn causes herbivore number to decline The prey population eventually recovers starting a new cycle This suggests that the population of the herbivore fluctuates around the carrying capacity of the food source in this case the plant,0 0 0 0 0 Predator Prey 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In some ways it is easier to be an herbivorous animal than a carnivore animal Carnivorous animals have to find and catch the animals that they eat and sometimes the animals that they want to eat fight them Herbivorous animals have to find the plants that they want to eat but they do not have to catch them Many plants have some defence against herbivores such as spines toxins or a bad taste There are many more herbivorous animals living in the world than carnivorous animals,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Carnivore 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Taste 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Atheism is rejecting the belief in a deity or gods,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Deity 0 0
While theism refers to belief in one or more gods gnosticism refers to knowledge In theory one can identify as a gnostic theist agnostic theist gnostic atheist or agnostic atheist As an example an agnostic theist lacks knowledge but believes in a god or gods nonetheless In practice most people simply identify as a theist atheist or agnostic,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Atheists often give reasons why they do not believe in a god or gods Three of the reasons that they often give are the problem of evil the argument from inconsistent revelations and the argument from nonbelief Not all atheists think these reasons provide complete proof that gods cannot exist but these are the reasons given to support rejecting belief that gods exist,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some atheists do not believe in any god because they feel that there is no evidence for any Monotheism nor Polytheism so believing any type of theism means believing unproved These atheists think a simpler explanation for everything is Naturalism  which means that only natural things exist Occam s razor shows simple explanations without many unproved guesses are more likely to be true,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Monotheism 0 Polytheism 0 0 0 0 0 Theism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Photosynthesis can happen in different ways but there are some parts that are common,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Light energy from the sun is used to split water molecules The sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant causing an enzyme to break apart the water Water when broken makes oxygen hydrogen and electrons in the pathway of Dolai s S state diagrams,0 0 0 0 Sun 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Enzyme 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Oxygen Hydrogen 0 Electrons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Hydrogen along with electrons energized by light converts NADP into NADPH which is then used in the light independent reactions Oxygen diffusion out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis and ATP is synthesized from ADP and Inorganic compound phosphate This all happens in the grana of chloroplasts,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 NADPH 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Diffusion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Adp 0 Inorganic_Compound Phosphate 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chloroplasts
During this reaction sugars are built up using carbon dioxide and the products of the light dependent reactions and various other chemicals found in the plant in the Calvin Cycle Therefore the light independent reaction cannot happen without the light dependent reaction Carbon dioxide diffuses into the plant and along with chemicals in the chloroplast ATP and NADPH glucose is made and finally transported around the plant by Translocation ,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Calvin_Cycle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
If there is little light shining on a plant the light dependent reactions will not work efficiently This means that photolysis will not happen quickly and therefore little NADPH and ATP will be made This shortage of NADPH and ATP will lead to the light independent reactions not working as NADPH and ATP are needed for the light independent reactions to work,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Carbon dioxide is used in the light independent reactions It combines with NADPH and ATP and various other chemicals to form glucose Therefore if there is not enough carbon dioxide then there will be a buildup of NADPH and ATP and not enough glucose will be formed,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

When talking about the Bible a book is used to speak about a number of texts All the texts that make a book are believed to belong together Most of the time people believe they were written or collected by the same person The Bible contains different kinds of such books Some are history telling the stories of the Jews Jesus or Jesus followers Some are collections of wise sayings Some are God s commands to his people which he expects them to obey Some are songs of praise to God Some are books of prophecy messages from God that he gave through chosen people called prophets,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Jews Jesus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Wise 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Prophecy 0 0 God 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The next step in translation was done in 1525 by William Tyndale His translation was into Early Modern English which we can just about understand today Tyndale also did it without Church permission His was the first translation to be printed and several thousand copies were made He had no protector and his fate was terrible He fled to Europe but the agents of Thomas More eventually found him Both Tyndale and his printer were executed by burning at the stake,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 William_Tyndale 0 0 0 0 Early_Modern_English 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Thomas_More 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A suburb is an area of a town or city a little away from the main part where there are fewer big buildings and mainly houses schools and shops Such places are called suburbs Sometimes the suburbs cover a very large area The suburbs are part of the metropolitan area and may be legally part of the main city or not,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Town 0 City 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Buildings 0 0 Houses Schools 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Since the Industrial revolution urbanization has spread very quickly and far Transport in the form of trams buses and cars allows commuting from distant homes to work in the inner city This led to the growth of suburbs as residential areas Housing commonly includes detached and semi detached houses and flats Houses are built farther apart than in the inner city and there is often space for gardens and parks,0 0 Industrial_Revolution Urbanization 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Trams Buses 0 Cars 0 Commuting 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Houses 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gardens 0 0
As cities grow outwards they begin to take over the surrounding countryside Authorities have created Green belts on the undeveloped land around a city to prevent urban sprawl and to prevent the towns and cities merging into one They also encourage development within the town and protect the countryside The need for new houses particularly large detached and semi detached houses in pleasant surroundings means that some areas of green belt land have been built on and others are threatened That s because it is cheaper to build on empty land than to redevelop brownfield sites in older parts of the town or city,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Ptolemy is the English language name for Claudius Ptolemaeus He was a Ancient Greece who probably lived and worked in Alexandria in Egypt He lived from about 85 to 165 A D He is famous for his work on astronomy and geography Very little is known about his personal life,0 0 0 English_Language 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancient_Greece 0 0 0 0 0 0 Alexandria 0 Egypt 0 0 0 0 85 0 165 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Astronomy 0 Geography 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This system became known as the Ptolemaic system It predicts the positions of the planets accurately enough for naked eye observations so it seemed accurate at the time This is described in his book Mathematical Syntaxis a thirteen book mathematical treatment of the phenomenon of astronomy It contains a wide variety of information ranging from earth conceptions to sun moon and star movement as well as eclipses and an explanation of the length of months The Almagest also included a star catalog containing 48 constellations using the names we still use today,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Phenomenon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Months 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In addition to his well known works in astronomy Claudius Ptolemy was very important in the history of geography and cartography He was influential up to the 16th century when his ideas were disproved by Nicolaus Copernicus Ptolemy of course knew that the Earth is a sphere Ptolemy s is the first known projection of the sphere onto a plane  His Geography remained the main work on the subject until the time of Christopher Columbus But he had Asia extending much too far east which may have been a factor in Columbus s decision to try to reach India by sailing west from Europe,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cartography 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nicolaus_Copernicus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sphere 0 0 0 0 0 0 Projection 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Christopher_Columbus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The Ptolemaic explanation of the motions of the planets remained the accepted wisdom until the Polish scholar Copernicus proposed a heliocentric view or sun centered view in 1543 It should be noted too that Ptolemy s system is actually more accurate than Copernicus s The heliocentric formulation does not improve on Ptolemy s until Kepler s Laws are also added,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1543 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Kepler 0 0 0 0

A wave is a kind of oscillation that travels through space and matter Wave motions transfer energy from one place to another,0 0 0 0 0 0 Oscillation 0 0 0 Space 0 Matter 0 0 0 Energy 0 0 0 0 0
Waves have properties that can be measured All waves can be pictured by adding sine waves,0 0 Properties 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Sine waves can be measured too The shape of a sine wave is given by its amplitude phase wavelength and frequency The speed that the sine wave moves can be measured The amplitude and wavelength of the sine wave is shown in the picture,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Amplitude Phase Wavelength 0 Frequency 0 Speed 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The highest point on a wave is called the peak The lowest point is called the trough The peak of a wave and the trough of a wave are always twice the wave s amplitude apart from each other The part of the wave half way in between the peak and the trough is called the baseline,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Some waves can move through matter while others cannot For instance some waves can move through empty Space  light waves for example Sound waves on the other hand cannot move through empty space Inherently all waves carry energy from one place to another when they move In some applications of technology waves may carry meaningful information from one place to another such as news on the radio,0 0 0 0 0 Matter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Energy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Information 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Usually after a wave moves through matter the matter is the same as it was before the wave was introduced though in some cases matter can be affected by waves traveling through it In 1922 Louis de Broglie found out that all waves are also particles and all particles are also waves,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Particles 0 0 0 0 0 0
One important debate in human science is whether the exchange of culture is only among humans or if it also goes on among our Great Ape near relatives If so then culture is part of primatology and there is no clear line between human science and life sciences,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Culture 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Primatology 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Another name for human science is Social Science since the most complex thing about humans is how they relate to each other in society The most general social science is ethics or economics depending on your point of view,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Society 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ethics 0 Economics 0 0 0 0 0 0
However life science also deals with humans as objects of study while hard science such as chemistry deals with humans as the observer who does the study sets the scale at which observation can happen incurs observer effects as studied in philosophy of science,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hard_Science 0 0 Chemistry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Scale 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Often sciences have different names based on whether they study humans or not For instance economics is the study of how humans make a living while ecology is the study of how non humans make a living Medicine is normally restricted to humans while veterinary medicine refers to the same techniques made on other species One relies more on ethics and less on economics when dealing with humans at least according to any ethical tradition,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Economics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ecology 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Medicine 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ethics 0 0 0 Economics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Infinity is not really an ordinary number but it is sometimes used as one Infinity often says how many there is of something instead of how big something is For example there are infinitely many whole numbers but there is no integer which is infinitely big But different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity So its meaning often changes,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Numbers that describe data that you can see are called descriptive statistics Numbers that make predictions about data that you can t see are called inferential statistics,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Descriptive statistics involves using numbers to describe features of data For example the average height of women in the United States is a descriptive statistic that describes a feature of a population,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Once the results have been summarized and described they can be used for prediction This is called Inferential Statistics As an example the size of an animal is dependent on many factors Some of these factors are controlled by the environment but others are by inheritance A biologist might therefore make a model that says that there is a high probability that the offspring will be small in size if the parents were small in size This model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random Testing whether a certain drug can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those of people who are given a placebo,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Most often we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments For example an opinion poll is one kind of survey We pick a small number of people and ask them questions Then we use their answers as the data,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Experiments 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Questions 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important as it directly the statistics When the statistics are done it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake If we take samples next to the waste drain we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far away hard to reach spot of the lake,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
We can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly However sometimes large random samples are hard to take And bias can happen if different people are not asked or refuse to answer our questions or if they know they are getting a fake treatment These problems can be hard to fix See also standard error,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

There can be more than one mode For example if in a room there are 10 people with incomes of 10  20  20 20  50  60 90  90  90  100 and 1 000 000  the modes are 20 and 90 This is bi modal or has two modes Bi modality is very common and often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups For instance the average height of all adults in the U S has a bi modal distribution This is because males and females have separate average heights of 1 763 m for men and 1 622 m for women These peaks are apparent when both groups are combined,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is A common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the standard deviation If the standard deviation of a set of data is small then most of the data is very close to the average If the standard deviation is large though then a lot of the data is very different from the average,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
If the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution then it is very useful to know the standard deviation If the data follows this pattern about 68 of every 100 pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation Not only that but about 95 of every 100 measurements will be off the average by less that two times the standard deviation and about 997 in 1000 will be closer to the average than three standard deviations,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Then the beans are spread out constantly raked over and dried On large plantations this is done on huge trays either outdoors by sunshine or in sheds by artificial heat However thousands of tons from smaller producers are dried on small trays or on cowhides Finally the beans are trodden and shuffled about and sometimes during this process red clay mixed with water is sprinkled over the beans to obtain a finer color polish and protection against molds during shipment to factories in the United States the Netherlands United Kingdom and other countries About 3 000 000 tonnes of cocoa are grown each year The Netherlands is the leading cocoa processing country followed by the U S,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Clay 0 0 Water 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 United_States 0 Netherlands United_Kingdom 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tonnes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The Hubble Space Telescope is the first big optical space observatory telescope Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground The atmosphere blurs starlight before it reaches Earth Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day The main mirror is 94 5 inches across The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Atmosphere 0 0 0 0 0 Sky 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earth 0 0 0 0 Edwin_Hubble 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

When the HST took its first pictures astronomers were happy to see the images but they were not as sharp and as crisp as expected Telescopes in space can take better pictures than telescopes on Earth but for some reason the pictures were not better than the pictures taken on Earth They found a problem with the telescope s mirror The mirror was not curved right It was only wrong by 2 2 microns Still this was enough to cause the images to be blurred Some said that Hubble was myopia,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Myopia
Another space shuttle was soon sent up to repair the space telescope The repair was not easy The astronauts had to install some small mirrors to correct the light from the big mirror The big mirror could still be used It took five days of space walks When an astronaut opened one of the doors on Hubble to install a new camera the door would not close The astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem Eventually Hubble was fixed,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In a couple centuries the Industrial Revolution was in full swing and many more discoveries were made in many fields of science The laws of classical physics are good enough to study objects that move much slower than the speed of light and are not microscopic When scientists first studied quantum mechanics they had to create a new set of laws which was the start of Modern Physics,0 0 0 0 0 Industrial_Revolution 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Quantum_Mechanics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
As scientists researched particles they discovered what classical mechanics could not explain Classical mechanics predicted that the speed of light varied but experiments showed the speed of light stayed the same This was predicted by Albert Einstein s theory of special relativity Einstein predicted that the speed of electromagnetic radiation through empty space would always be the same His view of space time replaced the ancient idea that space and time were quite separate things,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Albert_Einstein 0 0 0 Special_Relativity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Space Time 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Physics is a quantity science because it is based on measure with numbers Mathematics is used in physics to make models that try to prediction what will happen in nature The guesses are compared to the way the real world works These guesses are made by theoretical physicists and they are compared to the real world by experimental physicists Physicists are always working to make their models of the world better,0 0 0 Quantity 0 0 0 0 0 0 Measure 0 Numbers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Prediction 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 World 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The sweep of physics is broad from the smallest components of matter and the forces that hold it together to galaxy and even larger things There are only four forces that appear to operate over this whole range However even these four forces are believed to be different parts of a single force,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Galaxy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Forces 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Forces 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Physics uses the scientific method That is data from experiments and observations are Theories which attempt to explain these data are produced Physics uses these theories to not only describe physical phenomena but to model physical systems and predict how these physical systems will behave Physicists then compare these predictions to observations or experimental evidence to show whether the theory is right or wrong,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In 1492 Columbus landed on an island of the Bahamas the first European to do so His initial goal was to find a quicker route to Asia from Europe He is credited with the discovery of the New World because his voyage started the era of Colonialism in the Americas This was an important moment in European history While Leif Erikson was the first European to land on the soils of Americas it was not well documented and did not lead to the later contact between Europe and the New World,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bahamas 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Colonialism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Americas 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Many people in Western Europe wanted to find a shorter way to get to Asia Columbus thought he could get to Asia by sailing west He did not know about the countries in the Western Hemisphere so he did not realize they would block him from getting to Asia,0 0 0 Western_Europe 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 West 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Western_Hemisphere 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

On September 24 1493 Columbus left Spain with enough ships supplies and men to invasion and colonization in the New World He had 17 ships and 1 200 men These men included soldiers and farmers There were also priests whose job was to religious conversion the natives to Christianity,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Invasion 0 Colonization 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Farmers 0 0 0 Priests 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Christianity

Then he went back to the Navidad fort He found the fort burned down Eleven of the 37 soldiers Columbus left at the fort were burial there The rest had disappeared Historians think this happened because of disease and fights with the Arawak people,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Burial 0 0 0 0 0 Historians 0 0 0 0 0 Disease 0 0 0 0 0 0
While Columbus was away from Navidad exploring Jamaica and Cuba his soldiers stopped working on building a new fort and farms They made the Arawaks give them food They also theft things from the Arawaks and raped Arawak women This made the Arawaks decide to fight back against the Spaniards However Spain had many weapons that the Arawaks had never seen including steel swords pikes crossbows dogs and horses This made it much easier for Spain to win fights against the Arawaks,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Theft 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Steel 0 0 0 0 0 Horses 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Columbus also took revenge against the Arawaks for killing his soldiers at Navidad He made every native older than 14 give him a certain amount of gold every three months If a person did not do this Columbus s men would cut off their hands and they would bleeding to death Historian Carl Lehrburger says that about 10 000 natives died this way Columbus also led his soldiers to many different villages in Hispaniola to take them over and make them pay him gold also If they could not pay the gold people would be made into slaves or killed,0 0 0 Revenge 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hands 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
On August 19 1498 Columbus returned to Hispaniola He found that many of the Spanish settlers there were unhappy They thought there would be more gold in the New World Some of them had rebellion while he was gone Columbus had five of the rebellion s leaders hanging He also tried to make the rest of the settlers happy by giving them land in Hispaniola However the settlers kept sending to Spain In 1499 Queen Isabella sent a man named Francisco de Bobadilla to Hispaniola She gave him the power to do whatever he thought he should do When he arrived in 1500 the first thing he did was to have Columbus arrested and sent back to Spain in chains,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rebellion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hanging 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When he was trying to make Spanish settlers happy Columbus started the Encomienda system in Hispaniola Under this system Columbus would give a piece of land in Hispaniola to an individual Spanish settler Sometimes he would give away a whole native village Any natives that lived in that area had to work for that Spanish settler Natives had lived on this land for centuries Columbus was giving their land away and then forcing them to work on that land,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Columbus had a few different goals for his journeys to the New World First he believed he could find a shorter and easier route to Asia which made things Europe did not He believed he could find a shorter route to China Other people had called this belief Columbus wanted to prove these people wrong 1522 editor National Geographic Books date 184 185 isbn After Columbus Legacy References,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 China 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In the paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise Achilles allows the tortoise a of 100 Metre for example Suppose that each racer starts running at a constant speed one very fast and one very slow After some finite time Achilles will have run 100 metres bringing him to the tortoise s starting point During this time the slower tortoise has run a much shorter distance It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther It will then take still more time for Achilles to reach this third point while the tortoise again moves ahead Thus whenever Achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been he still has farther to go Therefore because there are an infinite number of points Achilles must reach where the tortoise has already been he can never overtake the tortoise matchforum org,0 0 0 0 Achilles 0 0 Tortoise 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Metre 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Finite 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infinite 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The Sahel is a narrow belt of land in West Africa It is a strip of dry land about 5500 kilometers long and 450 kilometres wide It lies at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert and is located between the dry desert land to the north and the forest areas to the south The Sahel has a tropical semi arid climate The temperature is high throughout the year There is little rainfall in the Sahel It is concentrated during summer months and can be unreliable It may be very dry in some years especially if a large area of low pressure which brings rain is not carried North over the Sahel by strong winds,0 0 0 0 0 Belt 0 0 0 0 Africa 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Kilometers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sahara_Desert 0 0 0 0 0 0 Desert 0 0 0 0 0 0 Forest 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Climate 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rainfall 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Summer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The Sahel is facing a big problem Desertification,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Desertification
As the climate of Sahel was mainly dry and hot and leads to a high evaporation rate and also little rainfalls The distribution of rainfall in the Sahel region is uneven The rainfall in the region has been below average since 1970 The Sahel is becoming drier on the whole The problem of drought affects most of the countries As a result crops and animals die There is no vegetation to protect the soil which is then removed by flash floods and strong wind This leads to soil erosion Finally the desert spreads towards the surrounding areas,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
With better medical services the birth rate increases and the death rate decreases in the Sahel As a result the population in the Sahel is growing To meet the ever increasing demand for firewood a lot of trees have been cut down More land has become barren This is called deforestation,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

People keep animals for food due to the lack of good soil the animals will have to eat grass and etc But as the animals eat the grass they also dug up the soil As the people keep too many animals the demand of grass is too much and while the animals keep digging the soil up as they eat and the wind and rain will blow away the soil which causes soil erosion this process is called overgrazing,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Rare metals with high value like gold silver and platinum are often used to make jewellery Metals are also used to make fasteners and screws Pots used for cooking can be made from copper aluminium steel or iron Lead is very heavy and dense and can be used as ballast in boats to stop them from turning over or to protect people from ionizing radiation,0 0 0 0 0 0 Gold Silver 0 Platinum 0 0 0 0 0 Jewellery 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cooking 0 0 0 0 Copper Aluminium Steel 0 Iron Lead 0 0 Heavy 0 Dense 0 0 0 0 0 Ballast 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In chemistry metal is a word for a group of chemical chemical element that have certain properties It is easy for the atoms of a metal to lose an electron and become positive ions or cations In this way metals are not like the other two kinds of elements the nonmetals and the metalloids Most chemical element on the periodic table are metals,0 Chemistry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Properties 0 0 0 0 0 Atoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electron 0 0 0 Ions 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Metalloids 0 0 0 0 Periodic_Table 0 0
On the periodic table we can draw a zigzag line from the chemical element boron to the chemical element polonium The elements that this line passes through are the metalloids The elements that are above and to the right of this line are the nonmetals The rest of the elements are the metals,0 0 Periodic_Table 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Boron 0 0 0 Polonium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Metalloids 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Most of the properties of metals are due to the fact that the atoms in the metal do not hold onto their electrons very tightly Each atom is separated from the others by a thin layer of valence electrons,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Atoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electrons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Layer 0 Valence Electrons
However some metals are different An example is the metal sodium It is melts at a low temperature and is so density it floats on water People should not try this though because another property of sodium is that it explodes when it touches water,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sodium 0 0 0 0 0 0 Temperature 0 0 0 Density 0 0 0 Water 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sodium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Water
Most metals are chemically stable and do not react easily but some do react The reactive ones are the alkali metals like sodium and the alkaline earth metals like calcium When metals do react they often react with oxygen The oxides of metals are Base  The oxides of nonmetals are acidic,0 0 0 0 Stable 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Alkali 0 0 Sodium 0 0 Alkaline 0 0 Calcium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Oxygen 0 Oxides 0 0 0 0 0 Oxides 0 0 0 Acidic

Archaeologists think that people became more organised in the Bronze Age because the making of metal tools was difficult and needed certain skills The people who had these new skills would have been important The new metal tools were bought sold or traded across larger distances,Archaeologists 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Later when iron tools spread the Bronze Age ended and the Iron Age started A reason for iron replacing bronze is that tin ore a rock in which tin may be found is much more rare than iron ore Copper tools were not useful because they were too soft,0 0 Iron 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Iron_Age 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ore 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The land was plowed by teams of oxen pulling light unwheeled plows and grain was harvested with sickle Wagons had solid wheels covered by leather tires kept in position by copper nails and were drawn by oxen As many as four animals could pull a wagon at one time The horse was domesticated in Ukraine around 4000 BC and was in use by the Sumerians around 2000 BC,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Oxen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sickle 0 0 0 Wheels 0 0 Leather 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ukraine 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In some major societies whose governments have called themselves socialist corruption and lack of incentive for workers to produce have reduced production and the average standard of living Similar kinds of corruption have had other negative effects on societies considered Capitalist However in many of the societies of Western Europe which have adopted progress toward democratic socialism productivity standards of living incentives and markers of personal happiness and security are very high,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Even though this has never yet happened some socialists believe that socialism will over time turn into what they see as a more advanced system with no state money or social classes Because the tools for making and distributing things are owned by everyone in socialism more jobs will be replaced by machines until the amount of human work needed is made as low as possible so they say that this will let everyone get what they want without using money This is called Communism and these socialists are called communists,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 State Money 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Communism 0 0 0 0 0 0

Social democracy is a kind of socialism that tries to mix parts of socialism with capitalism In this system the government takes wealth from the rich and gives it to the poor like in a Communist state but despite there being more government control and less chance to make a very large amount of money people can still run their own businesses and own private property Unlike communism where all private property is taken to be owned publicly people and businesses pay taxes on their property and this money is spent on public services after taking out the costs of running the government and collecting the taxes The main method of democratic socialism is changing society through slow reform rather than a quick revolution,Social_democracy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Capitalism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Reform 0 0 0 0 Revolution

In early times submarines were often powered by hand This is because boat engines had not been invention yet They were almost always designed to be used for war Submarines would try to sink enemy ships by crude methods These included drilling screws into their wooden hulls Some tried to explosion a ship This often destroyed the submarine too,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Engines 0 0 0 Invention 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Wooden 0 0 0 0 Explosion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Later during the World War I and World War II better submarines were made Many of these better submarines were created by Nazi Germany called U boat s The submarines were powered by a diesel electric system A diesel motor would be used to turn a generator The generator would charge a large battery while the submarine was on the surface The power in the battery was then used by the submarine when it went underwater These submarines were dangerous to enemies They were hard to see while underwater but it was easy to attack them when they surfaced to recharge Even many navies today still use this diesel electric concept but the boats in use today are larger and more modern,0 0 0 World_War_I 0 World_War_II 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nazi_Germany 0 U Boat 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Diesel Electric 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Generator 0 0 0 0 0 0 Battery 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Attack 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The First Battle of the Atlantic was the first major battle that was mainly fought between submarines and their enemies As in later wars the main jobs of submarines were to enforce a blockade and to sink enemy warships They usually attacked freighters at night shooting with their Deck gun and then hiding under the water Sometimes they used their torpedoes which they could fire while underwater especially against larger ships and warships During World War II The US Navy lost around 52 submarines due to combat and non combat causes,0 First_Battle_of_the_Atlantic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Blockade 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Most large modern military submarines are powered by nuclear reactors These submarines often have a system which can get air from the seawater These two things allow them to stay under water for long periods of time Their most important uses are attacking ships or launching missiles These include cruise missiles and nuclear missiles There are two main kinds of subs Attack submarines are small and fast They attack other subs and surface ships with torpedo Ballistic missile submarine are larger and slower They are built to shoot missiles at far away targets on land,0 0 0 Military 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Seawater 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Missiles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Torpedo 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The other reason that alphabets never exactly fit languages is dialect A spoken language varies from place to place and from time to time This is very obvious with English as the pronunciation is so different in different parts of the world A written language will always be less flexible than its spoken parent It has a different function and is produced mechanically It must serve everyone who speaks the language and it does this by keeping the spelling similar from one time to another,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dialect 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Spelling though important is less important than how the language is used in practice The differences between British and American English in use are more to do with idiom slang and vocabulary than they are to do with spelling In this respect spelling in writing or print is a bit like pronunciation in speech They are the necessary outer clothes but the inner substance is more important,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Idiom Slang 0 Vocabulary 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pronunciation 0 Speech 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A player can also use one piece to make multiple jumps in any one single turn provided each jump continues to lead immediately into the next jump and in a straight line Sometimes a player may have the option or a choice of which opponent piece he must jump In such cases he may then choose which to jump If you keep your hand on any piece when you re moving you have the choice to put it back and move another piece,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Kings If a player s piece moves into back rank on the other player s side it becomes a king It can move forwards and backwards A king cannot move out of the King Row until the next turn In English draughts a king s only advantage over a man is the ability to move and capture backwards as well as forwards,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
How the game ends The first player to lose all of his or her pieces loses the game If a player is put in a position where they cannot move they lose If the players have the same amount of pieces the player with the most kings wins If the players have an equal number of pieces and the same number of kings the game is a draw,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Sometimes called Polish or international draughts A main difference is in the mobility of the kings In international draughts kings move any distance along unblocked diagonals and may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it Also the simple men can take backwards as well as forwards,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

HIV causes a person to become more prone to illness so infected people need treatment options However there is no cure for HIV To help ease negative symptoms drugs called anti retroviral therapy are available This treatment is also called high active anti retroviral therapy HAART treatment begins with one non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors The NRTI drug could be named zidovudine tenofovir andlamivudine or emtricitabine,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Symptoms Drugs 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
These drugs slow the progression of the HIV virus in the body Usually these treatments consist of a combination of three or more drugs and each drug performs a different job in fighting the virus In general HAART prevents the HIV from multiplying and destroying CD4 cells CD4 cells are necessary to help protect the body from infections and cancer Since the HIV virus destroys CD4 cells it causes people with HIV to be more prone to illness,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cancer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Another type of alternative therapy for treating HIV is micronutrient supplementation Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals so these supplements would be in the form of a general daily multivitamin These supplements have been proven to help treat HIV because HIV can cause micronutrient deficiencies so the supplements can help replenish these needed vitamins and minerals Although the supplements may not help ease all negative symptoms they offer some benefits and are safe for HIV infected patients Supplements are also safe for HIV infected pregnant women and their children Specifically vitamin A and zinc have shown positive health effects There are no major negative side effects of vitamin and mineral supplements,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vitamins 0 Minerals 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Multivitamin 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vitamin_A 0 Zinc 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

All gases can Flux like liquids This means the molecules move about independently of each other Most gases are colourless like hydrogen Gas particles will spread about or diffuse in order to fill all the space in any container such as a bottle or a room Compared to liquids and solids gases have a very low density and viscosity We cannot directly see most gases since they aren t coloured However it is possible to measure their density volume temperature and pressure,0 0 0 Flux 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Diffuse 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Density 0 Viscosity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Density Volume Temperature 0 Pressure
Pressure is the measure of how much pushing Force  something is putting on another object In a gas this is usually the gas pushing on the container of the object or if the gas is heavy something inside the gas Pressure is measured in Pascal  Because of Newton s third law we can change the pressure of a gas by putting force on the object containing it For example squeezing a bottle with air inside pressurises to the air inside,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Newton 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When talking about gas pressure is often related to the container A lot of gas in a small container would have very high pressure A small amount of a gas in a big container would have low pressure,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The temperature of a gas is how hot or cold it is In physics it is usually measured in kelvins although degrees Celsius are more used elsewhere In a gas the average velocity of the molecules is related to the temperature The faster the gas molecules are moving the more they collide or smash into each other These collisions release energy which in a gas comes in the form of heat Conversely if the temperature around the gas becomes hotter then the gas particles will convert the thermal energy to kinetic energy making them move faster and making the gas hotter,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Physics 0 0 0 0 0 Kelvins 0 0 Celsius 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Energy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Heat 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A gas can go through two different state changes If the temperature is low enough the gas can condensation and turn into a liquid Sometimes if the temperature is low enough it can go through deposition where it changes straight to a solid Normally a gas must first condense to a liquid and then freezing to become a solid but if the temperature is very low it can skip the liquid stage and instantly become solid Frost on the ground in winter is caused by this Water vapour goes into the air which is very cold and instantly becomes ice due to deposition,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Condensation 0 0 0 0 Liquid 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Deposition 0 0 0 0 0 0 Solid 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Freezing 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Water_vapour 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ice 0 0 0

One of the angles of a right triangle is always equal to 90 degree  This angle is the right angle The two sides next to the right angle are called the legs and the other side is called the hypotenuse The hypotenuse is the side opposite to the right angle and it is always the longest side It was discovered by Vasudha Arora,0 0 0 Angles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Right_Angle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hypotenuse 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Originally the word skyscraper meant a tall sail on a sailing ship Over time the word s meaning has changed and today it means a tall building Until the nineteenth century buildings taller than six stories tall were not common Tall buildings made of weak materials would fall down In addition people did not like walking up many steps and running water could only be brought up to fifty feet high,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sail 0 0 0 Ship 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Water 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Most marsupial and eutherian mammals have a reproductive cycle known as the oestrous cycle Females are sexually active only during the oestrous stage when they are on heat for a few days each month If an ovum is not fertilized the endometrium is resorbed Oestrus cycles may occur once or twice a year or many times a year Each group of mammals has its own frequency,0 Marsupial 0 Eutherian 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ovum 0 0 0 0 Endometrium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Humans and primates are quite different They have a menstrual cycle In this case females are sexually receptive at any time but only fertile when an ovum is released from an ovary In this case the endometrium is discarded The endometrium is shed and takes with it a certain amount of blood In this system eggs are released from the ovaries mostly in the middle of the cycle away from the menstrual period This ovulation is concealed meaning it is not obvious when it occurs This process so it is thought tends to keep the male and female together which is unusual in mammals with the oestrous cycle,Humans 0 Primates 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ovulation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In terms of number of species mammals with 5488 species are not the most successful vertebrates Birds with about 10 000 species have nearly twice as many and reptiles have just as many as birds Fish have even more species There are 27 000 species of fish of which nearly 26 000 are bony fish Nelson Joseph S 2006 Fishes of the World 4th ed John Wiley,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Karl Marx said that for society to change into a communist way of living there would have to be a period of change During this period the workers would govern society Marx was very interested in the experience of the Paris Commune of 1870 when the workers of Paris ran the city following the defeat of the French Army by the Prussian Army He thought that this practical experience was more important than the Theory views of the various Extremism groups,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Paris 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Theory 0 0 0 0 Extremism 0
Many groups and individuals liked Marx s ideas By the beginning of the Twentieth Century there was a worldwide socialist movement called Social Democracy It was influenced by his ideas They said that the workers in different countries had more in common with each other than the workers had in common with the bosses within their own countries In 1917 Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky led a Russian group called the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution They got rid of the temporary government of Russia which was formed after the February Revolution against the Tsar They established the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics also called the Soviet Union or USSR,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Twentieth_Century 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vladimir_Lenin 0 Leon_Trotsky 0 0 Russian 0 0 0 Bolsheviks 0 0 October_Revolution 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 February_Revolution 0 0 Tsar 0 0 0 Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A disease can be caused by many things Sometimes germs enter our body through food water or air A person can be Infection by infectious agents like bacteria viruses or fungus Disease can also be caused by eating bad or old foods There are small Pathogen in old foods that can cause diseases Sometimes the germs produce chemicals or toxins which causes the disease,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Germs 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infection 0 0 0 0 Bacteria Viruses 0 Fungus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pathogen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Germs 0 Chemicals 0 0 0 0 0 0
One of the most common causes of disease is poor sanitation and lack of clean water Some deadly diseases like malaria in tropical parts of the world are spread by a mosquito Animals that spread disease are called vectors There are many vectors including snails ticks and fleas,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sanitation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Malaria 0 Tropical 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mosquito 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some people are born with Genetics diseases These are diseases because of an error or mutation in a person s DNA An example of a mutation is cancer Living or working in an unhealthy environment can also be a cause for diseases Diseases are more common in older people,0 0 0 0 0 Genetics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mutation 0 0 0 0 Dna 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cancer 0 0 0 0 0 0 Environment 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some diseases that are common or very bad are tested for even in people who are healthy If these diseases are found early they can be treated before they cause problems An example would be checking a woman for cervical cancer with a test called a pap smear If cervical cancer is found early it can be cured If it is found later it usually causes death Another example is immunization The basic of it is to make the body ready for a disease The body has its own defense against disease called the immune system One special characteristic of the immune system is its ability to remember If a person had been sick before and had recovered the immune system produce a substance called antibodies which fight the disease if it comes back to the person The antibody is specific to a particular disease or antigen An example of this is measles which is a virus A person usually a child who had never been sick with measles is given a milder form of the virus this cause the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus If this person is exposed to the same virus in the future the person s immune system will remember and will fight the virus,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Immunization 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Immune_System 0 0 0 0 0 Immune_System 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Antibodies 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Antigen 0 0 0 0 0 Measles 0 0 0 Virus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Measles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Virus 0 0 0 Immune_System 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Epidemiology is the study of the cause of disease Some diseases are more popular for people with common characteristics like similar origins sociological background food or nationality Without good epidemiological research some diseases can be hard to track and to name Some diseases can be taken for something else This is why epidemiology takes a huge part in understanding how to protect ourselves against viruses toxins and bacteria,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Wars have been fought to control natural resources for religion or culture reasons and over political balances of power They have been fought over legitimacy of particular laws They have been fought to settle arguments about land or money and many other issues The reasons behind any war are often very complex While a war can start for just about any reason there is usually more than one cause,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Religion 0 Culture 0 0 0 Political 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
From the earliest times individual states or political factions have used war to gain sovereignty over regions In one of the earliest civilizations in history Mesopotamia they were in a near constant state of war Ancient Egypt during its Early Dynastic Period  came about by war when Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt were joined together as one country about 3100 BC The Zhou Dynasty ruled Ancient China came to power in 1046 through war Scipio Africanus defeated Carthage leading Ancient Rome to begin a conquest of the known world Philip II of Macedon united a group of city states to become Ancient Greece,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mesopotamia 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancient_Egypt 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lower_Egypt 0 Upper_Egypt 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Zhou_Dynasty 0 Ancient_China 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Scipio_Africanus 0 Carthage 0 Ancient_Rome 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Philip_II_of_Macedon 0 0 0 0 City States 0 0 Ancient_Greece

Another kind of war existed from 1947 until 1991 called the Cold War This started when diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union broke down Both countries had nuclear weapons and both stood ready to use them against the other But there was no actual war between the two It ended with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 The cold war was also called a containment where the United States tried to prevent the spread of communism to other countries During the cold war the major powers did not fight themselves but often backed third parties in what was called a proxy war The Vietnam War is often given as an example of a proxy war But proxy wars happened long before the cold war and are still happening,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cold_War 0 0 0 0 0 0 United_States 0 0 Soviet_Union 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Containment 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Communism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vietnam_War 0 0 0 0 0 Example 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A war between peoples and groups in the same country is known as a civil war It is generally agreed there are two things that make a war a civil war It must be a struggle between groups in the same country or state over political control or to force a major change in the government s The second is that more than 1000 people have to have been killed with a minimum of 100 from each side The American Civil War is an example of a civil war While the figures are mere estimates the total American Civil War casualties are thought to be about 750 000,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Civil_War 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 State 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 American_Civil_War 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 American_Civil_War_casualties 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Only in the last 150 years or so have states agreed on international laws to limit warfare This has been mainly for Humanitarianism The Geneva conventions and the Hague Conventions are two examples of agreements that establish laws ing wars Collectively these are usually called International humanitarian law Because these are ed laws they those d in armed conflicts to follow the IHL Also a country must not only respect the law but they also need to make sure other countries respect it as well They cannot Turning a blind eye to countries who are not following IHC The first of these was the Geneva Convention in 1864 It became international law with the signatures of 10 countries,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Humanitarianism 0 Geneva_Conventions 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A black hole is found by its interaction with matter The presence of a black hole can be inference  by tracking the movement of a group of stars that orbit a region in space Alternatively when gas falls into a black hole caused by a binary star or nebula the gas spirals inward heating to very high temperatures and emitting large amounts of radiation This radiation can be detected from earthbound and Earth orbiting telescopes,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Matter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nebula 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Radiation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earth 0 Telescopes
Astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates and have also found evidence of supermassive black holes at the center of most galaxies After observing the motion of nearby stars for 16 years in 2008 astronomers found compelling evidence that a supermassive black hole of more than 4 million solar masses is located near the Sagittarius A region in the center of the Milky Way galaxy,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sagittarius_A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Milky_Way 0

Aboriginal people did not usually build houses except huts of grass leaves and bark They did not usually build walls or fences and there were no horses cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish traps made from stones piled up in the river and the remains of a few stone huts in Victoria  Australia and Tasmania The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked stone spearheads but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making The boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Victoria 0 0 Tasmania 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Boomerang 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit But there were no houses and no fences In most parts of the world people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way They belonged to the land like a baby belongs to its mother Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no one owned the land This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the 1700s in England laws were tough many people were poor and gaols were full A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread Many people were hung for small crimes But usually they were just thrown in gaol Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America But by the 1770s the colonies in America became the United States They were free from British rule and would not take England s convicts any more so England needed to find a new and less populated place,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts sailors marines a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 First_Fleet 0 0 0 0 0 0 Portsmouth 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Arthur_Phillip 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
For the first few years of the settlement things were very difficult No one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony Nobody had chosen them carefully There was only one man who was a farmer There was no one among the convicts who was a builder a brick maker or a blacksmith No one knew how to fix the tools when they broke All of the cattle escaped There were no cooking pots All the plants were different so no one knew which ones could be eaten It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Somehow the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor Arthur Phillip and another hut for the supply of food grew into a small town with streets a bridge over the stream a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today Settlements had spread out from Sydney firstly to Norfolk Island and to Van Diemen s Land and also up the coast to Newcastle where coal was discovered and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney and by 1820 farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Norfolk_Island 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Because Australia is such a very large land it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people In the early days of the colony a great number of explorers went out searching for good land to settle on,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some people like Captain Charles Sturt were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it Many of the explorers did not prepare very well or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year Some died like Burke and Wills Ludwig Leichhardt got lost twice The second time he was never seen again Major Thomas Mitchell was one of the most successful explorers He mapped the country as he went and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there The Henty Brothers had come from Tasmania had built themselves a house had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine,0 0 0 0 Charles_Sturt 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ludwig_Leichhardt 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Thomas_Mitchell 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tasmania 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In the 1980s many people liked to use an operating system called Unix But because it restricted the user from sharing and improving the system some people made a new operating system that would work like Unix but which anybody could share or improve MINIX similar to Unix was used as a teaching tool for university students to learn how operating systems worked MINIX also restricted its sharing and improvement by its users,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Unix 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Minix 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Philosophy is a way of thinking about the world the universe and society It works by asking very basic questions about the nature of human thought the nature of the universe and the connections between them The ideas in philosophy are often general and But this does not mean that philosophy is not about the real world Ethics for example asks about the ideas underlying our everyday lives Metaphysics asks about how the world works and of what it is made,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 World 0 Universe 0 Society 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ethics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Metaphysics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
There are different types of philosophy from different times and places Some philosophers came from Ancient Greece such as Plato and Aristotle Others came from Asia such as Confucius or Gautama Buddha Some philosophers are from the Middle Ages in Europe such as William of Ockham or Saint Thomas Aquinas,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancient_Greece 0 0 Plato 0 Aristotle 0 0 0 0 0 0 Confucius 0 Gautama_Buddha 0 0 0 0 0 Middle_Ages 0 0 0 0 William_of_Ockham 0 Saint_Thomas_Aquinas
Sometimes philosophy tries to answer the same questions as religion and science Philosophers do not all give the same answers to questions Some people think there are no right answers in philosophy only better answers and worse answers Many types of philosophy criticize or even attack the beliefs of science and religion,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Religion 0 Science 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The answers to these questions gives the different domains or categories of philosophy,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
However some people think that philosophy is harmful as philosophy encourages free thinking and often questions the beliefs that others hold For example philosophies such as some existentialist views say that there is no meaning to life or human existence except the meaning that we make up or invent People from some religions do not agree with the beliefs of existentialism,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Existentialist 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Philosophers ask questions about ideas They try to find answers to those questions Some thinkers find it very hard to find those words that best describe the ideas they have When they find answers to some of these questions philosophers often have the same problem that is how to best tell the answers they found to other people Depending on the meaning of the words they use the answers change,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Some philosophers say the only thing needed to answer a question is to find out what it means The only thing that makes philosophical questions difficult is that people do not really know what they mean Ludwig Wittgenstein held this view,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ludwig_Wittgenstein 0 0 0
Philosophers often use both real and imaginary examples to make a point For example they may write about a real or fictional person in order to show what they think a good person or a bad person is like,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some philosophers look for the simplest way to answer a question and say that is probably the right answer This is a process called Occam s razor Others believe that complicated answers to questions can also be right For an example of a philosophical problem see the God paradox,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 God_paradox
Philosophers use logic to solve problems and answer questions Logical consistency is a cornerstone of any acceptable theory Philosophers who disagree with a theory will often try to find a logical contradiction in a theory If they find a contradiction this gives them a reason to reject that theory If they do not find an inconsistency the philosopher might show that the theory leads to a conclusion which is either unacceptable or ridiculous This second approach is usually called reductio ad absurdum,0 0 Logic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Consistency 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Rickets is a disease that happens in young children It happens in children who do not get enough vitamin D and calcium It causes larger spaces inside bones and makes them dry like Sponge  It can make the legs curve toward each other or away from each other,0 0 0 Disease 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vitamin_D 0 Calcium 0 0 0 0 0 Bones 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
People need both vitamin D and calcium to make their bones strong,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Vitamin D helps the bones absorb calcium Low vitamin D makes it hard to absorb calcium,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The human body makes vitamin D 3 in the skin from cholesterol Then the liver changes vitamin D 3 into calcitriol which sends calcium from the blood into the bones The bones need calcium to stay strong However the skin will not make vitamin D 3 unless enough ultraviolet light shines on it Sunlight contains ultraviolet light so getting enough sun is one way of getting enough D 3,0 Human_Body 0 0 0 0 0 0 Skin 0 Cholesterol 0 0 Liver 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Blood 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ultraviolet 0 0 0 0 Sunlight 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Rickets can be prevented if a person gets plenty of calcium and vitamin D,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The best way to do this is to get a lot of sunlight and eat foods that have a lot of vitamin D and calcium in them However people who cannot get enough vitamin D and calcium this way can take supplements,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Calcium is absorbed best by the bones when it is taken in amounts of 500 600 grams or less Because of this doctors suggest eating smaller amounts of foods with calcium in them at different times in the day instead of all at once,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Grams 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Breastfeeding may not have enough vitamin D in it to prevent rickets Babies who are only breastfed and not fed any other foods may be given vitamin D drops to make sure they do not get rickets However this is not a significant risk if mothers and child have some exposure to sunlight Children with dark skin are more likely to need additional vitamin D,Breastfeeding 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

It may be used to try to achieve fairness in some system of ethics For instance if poor people and rich people are debating something a time limit may be imposed so that the rich people cannot keep debating until the poor people have to go to work and lose,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fairness 0 0 0 0 Ethics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Time limits are very important in accounting so that everyone can report their results at the same time This in turn creates deadlines for the accountant and those reporting,0 0 0 0 0 0 Accounting 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Accountant 0 0 0
However the deadline is imposed by an authority whereas the time limit is imposed by a system So there can be slack in a deadline so that results do not have to be reported always very fast,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Authority 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

An exponent tells you how many times a number is multiplied by itself,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
There are some basic rules used in exponentiation,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
there are m number of a s and n number of a s,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
by definition when dealing with exponents you are dealing with repeated multiplication of a base term so,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
See section below for more information on negative exponents,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
everything in the next row is proved by the rules in the exponent section,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

From these representations you should notice that the terms of the sine and cosine series combine along with some sign changes to make the exponential series By introducing the number i into the equation we get,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This result is often used as the beginning of the definition for complex number exponents,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Here using base 2 and exponent i we get,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Temple construction in India started nearly 2000 years ago The oldest temples that were built of brick and wood no longer exist Stone later became the preferred material Temples marked the transition of Hinduism from the Vedic religion of ritual sacrifices to a religion of Bhakti or love and devotion to a personal deity Temple construction and mode of worship is governed by ancient Sanskrit scriptures called agamas of which there are several which deal with individual deities There are substantial differences in architecture customs rituals and traditions in temples in different parts of India During the ritual consecration of a temple the presence of the universal all encompassing Brahman is invoked into the main stone deity of the temple through ritual thereby making the deity and the temple sacred and divine,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The Bhakti yoga school takes its name from the Hindu term that signifies a blissful selfless and overwhelming love of God as the beloved Father Mother Child or whatever relationship finds appeal in the devotee s heart The philosophy of Bhakti seeks to tap into the universal divinity through personal form which explains the proliferation of so many gods and goddesses in India often reflecting the singular inclinations of small regions or groups of people Seen as a form of Yoga or union it seeks to dissolve the ego in God since consciousness of the body and limited mind as self is seen to be a divisive factor in spiritual realization Essentially it is God who effects all change who is the source of all works who acts through the devotee as love and light Sins and evil doings of the devotee are said to fall away of their own accord the devotee shriven limitedness even transcended through the love of God The Bhakti movements rejuvenated Hinduism through their intense expression of faith and their responsiveness to the emotional and philosophical needs of India They can rightly be said to have affected the greatest wave of change in Hindu prayer and ritual since ancient times,0 Bhakti_Yoga 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Yoga 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Devotional songs called bhajans kirtan and arti are sometimes sung in conjunction with performance of puja This rather organic system of devotion attempts to aid the individual in connecting with God through symbolic medium It is said however that the bhakta through a growing connection with God is eventually able to eschew all external form and is immersed entirely in the bliss of undifferentiated Love in Truth,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Most Hindus who do eat meat do not eat beef Some do not even use leather products This is most likely because many Hindus have relied so heavily on the cow for all sorts of dairy products tilling of fields and fuel for fertiliser that its status as a willing caretaker of humanity grew to identifying it as an almost motherly figure Thus while most Hindus do not worship the cow and rules against eating beef arose long after the Vedas had been written it still has an honored place in Hindu society It is said that Krishna is both Govinda and Gopala and Shiva s attendant is Nandi the bull With the stress on vegetarianism and the sacred nature of the cow it is no wonder that most holy cities and areas in India have a ban on selling meat products and there is a movement among Hindus to ban cow slaughter not only in specific regions but in all of India,0 Hindus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Beef 0 0 0 0 0 Leather 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vedas 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Krishna 0 0 0 0 0 0 Shiva 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 India
Contrary to popular belief practiced Hinduism is neither polytheism nor strictly monotheism The various Hindu gods and avatars that are worshipped by Hindus are understood as different forms of One truth sometimes seen as beyond a mere god and as a formless Divine Ground akin but not limited to monism or as one monotheistic principle like Vishnu or Shiva,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Polytheism 0 0 Monotheism 0 0 Hindu_Gods 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Monism 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vishnu 0 Shiva

Worship of the said deities is often done through the aid of pictures or icons which are said not to be God themselves but conduits for the devotee s consciousness markers for the human soul that signify the ineffable and illimitable nature of the love and grandeur of God They are symbols of the greater principle representing and are never presumed to be the concept or entity itself Thus Hindu image worship is a form of iconolatry in which the symbols are venerated as putative sigils of divinity as opposed to idolatry a charge often levied at Hindus For more details on this form of worship see murti,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 God 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Murti

An oligarchy is a government ruled by a small group of powerful people These people may spread power equally or not equally An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or passed down from father to son An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several powerful people Some past examples of oligarchy are the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Apartheid South Africa A fictional example is the dystopian society of Oceania in the book Nineteen Eighty Four Some critics of representative democracy think of the United States as an oligarchy This view is shared by anarchism,0 Oligarchy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics 0 Apartheid South_Africa 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Four 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 United_States 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Anarchism

On a baseball field there are four bases The bases form a diamond that goes around the field to the right from the starting base The starting base is called home plate Home plate is a pentagon which is a shape that has five sides First base is on the right side of the field second base is at the top of the infield third base is on the left side of the field and home plate is at the back of the field where the catcher plays,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The baseball field or diamond has two main parts the infield and the outfield The infield is where the four bases are The outfield is beyond the bases from the view of home plate The lines from home plate to first base and home plate to third base are the foul lines and the ground outside of these lines is called foul territory A ball that is hit with a bat and flies between the foul lines is a fair ball and the batter and runners can try and run around the bases and score A ball that is outside the foul lines is a foul ball If the ball hits the ground in the foul area rather than being caught in the air the batter continues to bat and any runners must return to the base that they were on before the ball was hit If the batter has fewer than two strikes a foul ball counts as a strike If the batter already has two strikes and the foul ball is not caught in the air then the batter continues to hit If a ball is caught by a fielder in fair or foul ground the batter is out,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A base runner who touches home plate after touching all previous bases in order and without getting out scores a run  If the batter hits the ball over the fence without touching the ground it is a home run The batter and any base runners are allowed to advance to the home plate and score a run The fielding team can do nothing to stop them,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The first baseman s job is to make force plays at first base In a force play another infielder catches a ball that has touched the ground and throws it to the first baseman The first baseman must then touch the batter or the base with the ball before the batter can touch first base Then the batter is out First basemen need to have quick feet stretch well be quick and know how to catch wild throws First base is one of the most important positions as a significant number of plays happen there,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The second baseman s job is to cover the area to the right of second base and to back the first baseman up The shortstop s job is to cover the area between second and third bases This is where right handed batters usually hit ground balls The shortstop also covers second or third base and the near part of left field The shortstop is usually the best fielder on the team The third baseman needs to have a strong throwing arm This is because many times the batter will hit a ball toward third base The third baseman must throw the ball very quickly to the first baseman to get the runner out Because the balls that go to third base are usually hit very hard the third baseman must also be very quick,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The three outfielders are called the left fielder the center fielder and the right fielder because they stand in left field center field and right field Left field and right field are on the left and right sides if you look out from home plate Center field is straight ahead from home plate Center field is very big so the center fielder is usually the fastest,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When throwing the ball the pitcher must touch the pitchers mound with his foot The pitcher s rubber is on top of the mound The pitcher cannot take more than one step forward when he throws the ball That makes the pitcher throw the ball slower Many major league pitchers can throw the ball up to 100 miles per hour Throwing a baseball that fast can be bad for the body Pitchers can end up with a lot of injuries Doctors often will perform Tommy John surgery on a pitcher with an elbow injury The operation is named after Tommy John the first pitcher to have the surgery Today pitchers are able to recover from their injuries much more often than before Tommy John surgery,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Surgery 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tommy_John 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The batting team wants to get runs The batting team sends its players up to home plate in a special order This order is called the lineup Each team chooses its lineup at the start of the game After the game starts the team cannot change the order But the team can use a player who was not on the lineup The new player has to change with an original player The new player s name is written in the lineup where the original player s name was After the ninth player has batted the first player in the lineup starts again If a runner comes to home plate he scores a run Then he is not a base runner After scoring a run the player must leave the field until it is his turn again So a player can only score one run for each time he bats,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Meanwhile Mary still did not want to kill her cousin So she sent a Catholic priest Dr Feckenham to try to convert Jane to Catholicism That way Jane would not be a threat Jane was a firm Protestant and refused to become a Catholic Jane s execution was postponed from 9 February to 12 February to try and make her a Catholic The night before the execution Jane wrote many letters to her family and prepared her neck for the block The next morning her hair was tied back and she watched Guildford go very unwillingly to the block Then it was her turn,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

After the crowd left the blood was removed and Jane s body was brought to the church St Peter ad Vincula Since the church had just become Catholic and Jane was a Protestant they had to get permission from Queen Mary to bury her It was four hours until her maids were allowed to prepare her body for burial Jane s body was buried between former Queens Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard It is unknown what happened to her severed head,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Anne_Boleyn 0 Catherine_Howard 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Psychology shares other things with natural sciences as well For example a good psychological theory may be possible to prove wrong Just like in any natural science a group of psychologists can never be completely sure that their theory is the right one If a theory can be proved wrong but experiments do not prove it wrong then it is more likely that the theory is accurate This is called falsifiability,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Falsifiability
Psychologists use many tools as part of their daily work Psychologists use surveys to ask people how they feel and what they think They may use special devices to look at the brain and to see what it is doing Psychologists use computers to collect data as they measure how people behave in response to pictures words symbols or other stimulus Psychologists also use statistics to help them analyze the data that they get from their experiments,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Computers 0 0 Data 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Symbols 0 0 Stimulus 0 0 0 Statistics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Psychologists are people who work in the field of psychology A psychologist may work in either basic research or applied research Basic research is the study of people or animals to learn more about them Applied research is using what was learned from basic research to solve real world problems If he or she is qualified as a clinical psychology they may be a therapist or counsellor as well as a researcher,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Therapist 0 Counsellor 0 0 0 0 0
To become a psychologist a person must first get a basic degree at a university and then go to graduate school A Master s degree either MSc or MA allows beginning work like a School psychology A doctorate degree takes a longer time because it includes doing research and writing a detailed report called a dissertation or thesis The doctoral graduate uses the initials PhD or DPhil after his or her name Some clinical psychologists earn a Doctor of Psychology degree and use the initials PsyD after their name The American Psychological Association says that people need a PhD in order to call themselves a psychologist,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Thesis 0 0 0 0 0 0 Phd 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

If all the numbers in one row or column are multiplied by another number n then the determinant is multiplied by n Also if a matrix M has a column v that is the sum of two column matrices v 1 and v 2 then the determinant of M is the sum of the determinants of M with v 1 in place of v and M with v 2 in place of v These two conditions are called multi linearity,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A city called Silene had a large lake where a plague bearing dragon who breathed fire and disease lived The dragon poisoned all the countryside To please the dragon the people of Silene gave it a sheep every day for food and when there were no more sheep they gave their children to the dragon The children were chosen by a lottery,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lake 0 0 0 0 Dragon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lottery

A diesel electric engine is a diesel generator a diesel engine that drives an electric generator The generator feeds electric power to an electric motor which turns a driveshaft Its efficiency is higher than when an engine drives a shaft through gears Most locomotives and many ships use diesel electric drive,0 0 0 Engine 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Generator 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Driveshaft 0 Efficiency 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ships 0 0 0 0
Many diesel electric drives especially small ones store the electricity in a battery Some designs also store braking energy in a flywheel which can also charge a battery However these add even more complexity and weight to the vehicle so are more appropriate for city driving where service stations are always available and there is much stop and go driving,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Battery 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Flywheel 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Complexity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Because they do not require any change or investment in stations nor much in vehicle design diesel electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today s internal combustion engine When properly tuned they have low toxics and they use only about one third of the fossil fuel of most gasoline engines powering similar vehicles,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Investment 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gasoline 0 0 0 0

Universe is the name that we use to describe the collection of all the things that exist in space It is made of billions of stars and planets and enormous clouds of gas separated by a gigantic empty space which is called the universe,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Astronomers can use telescopes to look at very distant galaxies This is how they see what the universe looked like a long time ago This is because the light from distant parts of the universe takes a very long time to reach us From these observations it seems the physical laws and constants of the universe have not changed,Astronomers 0 0 Telescopes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Many people in history had ideas to explain the universe Most early s had the Earth at the centre of the Universe Some ancient Greece thought that the Universe has infinite space and has existed forever They thought it had a set of spheres which corresponded to the fixed stars the Sun and various planets The spheres circled about a spherical but unmoving Earth,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancient_Greece 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sun 0 0 Planets 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earth

The invention of the telescope in the Netherlands 1608 was a milestone in astronomy By the mid 19th century they were good enough for other galaxies to be distinguished The modern optical telescope is still more advanced Meanwhile the Isaac Newton dynamics showed how the Solar System worked,0 0 0 0 Telescope 0 0 Netherlands 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Isaac_Newton 0 0 0 0 Solar_System 0
The improvement of telescopes led astronomers to realize that the Solar System is in a galaxy made of billions of stars the Milky Way and that other galaxies exist outside it as far as we can see Careful studies of the distribution of these galaxies and their spectral lines have led to much of physical cosmology Discovery of the redshift showed that the Universe is expanding,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Galaxy 0 0 0 0 0 0 Milky_Way 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Redshift 0 0 0 0 0 0
The most used scientific model of the Universe is known as the Big bang theory The Universe from in which all the matter and energy of the Universe was concentrated Several independent experimental measurements support the expansion of space and more generally the Big Bang idea Recent observations support the idea that this expansion is happening because of Most of the matter in the Universe may be in a form which cannot be detected by present methods This has been named,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Big_Bang 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

According to space can get bigger faster than the speed of light but we can view only part of the universe because of the speed of light We cannot see space beyond the limitations of light the diameter of the Universe is at least 93 billion,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
It is estimated that the age of the Universe is 13 73 billion years and that the diameter of the Universe is at least 93 billion light years or 8 80 metres,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Metres
The matter that can be seen is spread throughout the universe when averaged over distances longer than 300 million light years However on smaller length scales matter is observed to form clumps many atoms are condensed into stars most stars into galaxies most galaxies into galaxy groups and clusters and lastly the largest scale structures such as the Great Wall of galaxies,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Atoms 0 0 0 Stars 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Great_Wall 0 0
The Universe appears to have a smooth space time continuum made of three Space  dimensions and one temporal dimension On the average space is very nearly flat meaning that Euclidean geometry is experimentally true with high accuracy throughout most of the Universe However the universe may have more dimensions and its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Space 0 0 0 0 0 Dimensions 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Euclidean_geometry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Special relativity holds in all the universe in local space and time Otherwise general relativity holds There is no explanation for the particular values that physical constants appear to have throughout our Universe such as Planck s constant h or the gravitational constant G Several conservation laws have been identified such as the conservation of charge conservation of momentum conservation of angular momentum and conservation of energy,Special_Relativity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 General_Relativity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Charge 0 0 Momentum 0 0 0 0 0 0 Energy
Accurate predictions of the universe s past and future require an accurate theory of gravitation The best theory available is Albert Einstein s general theory of relativity which has passed all experimental tests so far However since rigorous experiments have not been carried out on cosmological length scales general relativity could conceivably be inaccurate Nevertheless its predictions appear to be consistent with observations so there is no reason to adopt another theory,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Albert_Einstein 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
General relativity provides of a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric that must be solved from the distribution of mass energy and momentum throughout the universe Since these are unknown in exact detail cosmological models have been based on the cosmological principle which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic In effect this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the universe are equivalent to those of a fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average density The assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve Einstein s field equations and predict the past and future of the universe on cosmological time scales,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mass Energy 0 Momentum 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Other observations are not clearly answered by known physics According to the prevailing theory a slight imbalance of matter over antimatter was present in the universe s creation or developed very shortly thereafter Although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another producing photons a small residue of matter survived giving the present matter dominated universe,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Matter 0 Antimatter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Photons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A cake is a type of sweet dessert which is baking Originally it was a bread like food but no longer Cakes are often made to celebrate special occasions like birthdays There are many kinds of cakes It can be baked in an oven Some savory cakes are made on a griddle or a frying pan,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dessert 0 0 Baking 0 0 0 0 Bread 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Oven 0 Savory 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Just like bread cakes rise in the oven because they contain many small air bubbles As cakes rise the air bubbles expand This is why the cake batter expands in the pan There are two ways of forming the air bubbles which create different types of cakes Almost every kind of cake belongs to one of these families,0 0 Bread 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
These cakes are made with butter or another fat like vegetable shortening The common way is to mix the fat and sugar then add eggs and then add flour The fat should be soft It should not be hard or liquid Mixing sugar with fat creates many very small air bubbles Most birthday cakes are made this way Cupcakes are also made this way,0 0 0 0 0 Butter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sugar 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
These cakes are not made with solid butter or vegetable shortening Some of these cakes are made with melted butter or vegetable oil The common way is to mix the eggs and sugar and then add flour These cakes are often much taller lighter and often sponge than creamed fat cakes Angelfood cake and chiffon cakes are egg foam cakes Most grocery stores with bakeries sell angelfood cakes Angelfood cakes are made by beating egg whites with sugar This traps a lot of tiny air bubbles The eggs and sugar are mixed with other ingredients Then the cake is baked,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sponge 0 0 0 0 Angelfood_cake 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In 1774 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Quebec Act giving recognition to French law Roman Catholicism in Canada and French language in the colony The Quebec Act gave the Quebec people their first Charter of rights The Quebec Act made American colonists angry so they launched the American Revolution A 1775 invasion by the Continental Army was stopped at Quebec City In 1783 Quebec gave the territory south of the Great Lakes to the new United States of America In 1867 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the British North America Act which brought most of the provinces together,0 0 0 Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Roman_Catholicism_in_Canada 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rights 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 American_Revolution 0 0 Invasion 0 0 Continental_Army 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Great_Lakes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The conservative government of Maurice Duplessis dominated Quebec politics from 1944 to 1960 with the support of the Catholic Church The Quiet Revolution was a period of social and political change During the Quiet Revolution English Canadians lost their control over the Quebec economy the Roman Catholic Church became less important and the Quebec government took over the Hydroelectricity companies,0 Conservative 0 0 0 0 0 0 Politics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Economy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hydroelectricity 0

Topology is the study of how spaces are organized how the objects are structured in terms of position It also studies how spaces are connected It is divided into algebraic topology differential topology and geometric topology,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Topology has sometimes been called rubber sheet geometry because in topology of 2 dimensions there is no difference between a circle and a square but there is a difference between a circle and a figure eight The spaces studied in topology are called topological spaces They vary from familiar manifolds to some very exotic constructions,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Manifolds 0 0 0 0 0
In many problems we often divide a large space into smaller areas for instance a house is divided into rooms a nation into states a type of quantity into numbers etc Each of these smaller areas is next to other small areas and the places where the areas meet are connections If we write down on paper a list of spaces and the connections between them we have written down a description of a space a topological space All topological spaces have the same properties and are made of the same structure This makes it easier to study how spaces behave in general and to use general algorithms For instance to program a robot to navigate a house we simply give it a list of rooms the connections between each room and an algorithm that can determine the sequence of rooms to travel through to reach any other desired room,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Algorithms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do in order to work Programming languages are used to make all the computer programs and computer software A programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do something,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Computers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Computer_Programs 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
There are many types of programming languages Most programming languages do not follow one type alone so it is difficult to assign a type for each language The examples of each type are given in each section below because they are the best well known examples of that type,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Moons do not make their own light We can see the Earth s moon because it acts like a mirror and reflects the light of the Sun The same half of the moon faces toward Earth at all times no matter where it moves But different parts of the moon are lit up by the Sun so it looks different at different times of the month This change as seen from Earth is called the phases of the moon or lunar phases,0 0 0 0 0 0 Light 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mirror 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sun 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A moon s cycle is the time the moon takes to change from looking very bright and round to looking very small and thin and then back to bright and round again In the case of the Earth s moon this is about four weeks It does this about 13 times in one year The moon s cycle is about 28 days a bit shorter than a calendar month,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Weeks 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Calendar 0

For example the Earth s moon is kept in orbit by the gravitational pull from the Earth This is also the way the Earth is attracted to the Sun and stays in its orbit The orbit of the Earth s moon actually causes the tides and wave s on Earth,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sun 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tides 0 0 0 0

Galaxies are found in groups called galaxy clusters which are also held together by gravitation Our own Milky Way is the second largest galaxy in our Local Group Many smaller galaxies and star clusters are also held in the Local Group outside the two main galaxies They are all in orbits round one of the centre of gravity That means most of them move round either Andromeda or the Milky Way so it seems natural for astronomers to use the term satellite for these as well,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Milky_Way 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Local_Group 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

It is not known what the earliest music of the cave people was like Some architecture even some paintings are thousands of years old but old music could not survive until people learned to write it down The only way we can guess about early music is by looking at very old paintings that show people playing musical instruments or by finding them in archaeology digs The earliest piece of music that was ever written down and that has not been lost was discovered on a tablet written in Hurrians a language spoken in and around northern Mesopotamia from about 1500 BC,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cave 0 0 0 0 Architecture 0 0 Paintings 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Archaeology 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hurrians 0 Language 0 0 0 0 0 Mesopotamia 0 0 0 0

In the arts the Baroque was a Western cultural era which began near the turn of the 17th century in Rome It was exemplified by drama and grandeur in sculpture painting literature dance and music In music the term Baroque applies to the final period of dominance of imitative counterpoint where different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches sometimes inverting the echo and even reversing thematic material,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement The upper class also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence In similar profusions of detail art music architecture and literature inspired each other in the Baroque cultural movement as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns Some traits and aspects of Baroque paintings that differentiate this style from others are the abundant amount of details often bright polychromy less realistic faces of subjects and an overall sense of awe which was one of the goals in Baroque art,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The 19th century is called the Romantic music Composers were particularly interested in conveying their emotions through music An important instrument from the Romantic period was the piano Some composers such as Frederic Chopin wrote subdued expressive quietly emotional piano pieces Often music described a feeling or told a story using sounds Other composers such as Franz Schubert wrote songs for a singer and a piano player called Lied These Lieder told stories by using the lyrics of the song and by the imaginative piano accompaniment  Other composers like Richard Strauss and Franz Liszt created narratives and told stories using only music which is called a tone poem Composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms used the piano to play loud dramatic strongly emotional music,0 0 0 0 0 0 Romantic_music 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Piano 0 0 0 0 Frederic_Chopin 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Franz_Schubert 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lied 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lyrics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Franz_Liszt 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Franz_Liszt 0 Johannes_Brahms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

One of the most important 20th century composers Igor Stravinsky wrote music with very complicated chords and rhythms Some composers thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote Minimalism pieces which use very simple ideas In the 1950s and 1960s composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen experimented with electronic music using electronic circuits amplifiers and loudspeakers In the 1970s composers began using electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from rock and roll music such as the electric guitar They used these new instruments to make new sounds,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Igor_Stravinsky 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Minimalism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Karlheinz_Stockhausen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electric_Guitar 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Jazz is a type of music that was invented around 1900 in New Orleans  Louisiana in the south of the United States There were many black musicians living there who played a style of music called blues music Blues music was influenced by African music Blues music was a music that was played by singing using the harmonica or the acoustic guitar Many blues songs had sad lyrics about sad emotions or sad experiences such as losing a job a family member dying or having to go to jail,Jazz 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 New_Orleans 0 0 0 0 0 0 United_States 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Blues 0 0 0 0 0 0 African 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Jail
Jazz influenced other types of music like the classical music from the 1920s and 1930s Art music composers such as George Gershwin wrote music that was influenced by jazz Jazz music influenced pop music songs In the 1930s and 1940s many pop music songs began using chords or melodies from jazz songs One of the best known jazz musicians was Louis Armstrong,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Classical_Music 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 George_Gershwin 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Louis_Armstrong

Summer is a warm season because the days are longer and the Sun is high in the sky giving direct light to the ground Winter is a cold season because the days are shorter and the Sun is low in the sky giving indirect light to the ground Both the changes in the length of the day and the height of the Sun at noon are caused by the tilt of the Earth s spin axis with respect to the plane of the Earth s path around the Sun At any time in any season the northern and southern hemispheres have opposite seasons,Summer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sun 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Winter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Southern 0 0 0 0
Seasons begin and end on different dates in different countries In the United States people say the seasons begin at the solstices and equinoxes The summer solstice is the longest day of the year and the winter solstice is the shortest The equinox is the time when the day and the night are the same number of hours assuming the sun were a point of light at its center Since civil dawn occurs when the edge of the sun first appears over the horizon and civil dusk occurs when the edge drops over the horizon the civil length of day is 12 hours long several days prior to the equinoxes In the USA summer begins at summer solstice winter at winter solstice spring at the spring equinox and autumn at the autumnal equinox,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 United_States 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

There are two different types of calculus Differential calculus divides things into small pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next while integral calculus joins the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made overall by a series of changes Calculus is used in many different areas such as physics astronomy biology engineering economics medicine and sociology,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Physics Astronomy Biology Engineering Economics Medicine 0 Sociology
In the 1670s and 1680s Sir Isaac Newton in England and Gottfried Leibniz in Germany figured out calculus at the same time working separately from each other Newton wanted to have a new way to predict where to see planet in the sky because astronomy had always been a popular and useful form of science and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for navigation of ships Leibniz wanted to measure the space under a curve Many years later the two men argued over who discovered it first Scientists from England supported Newton but scientists from the rest of Europe supported Leibniz Most mathematician today agree that both men share the credit equally Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton such as its uses in physics Other parts come from Leibniz such as the symbols used to write it,0 0 0 0 0 0 Isaac_Newton 0 0 0 Gottfried_Leibniz 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Planet 0 0 0 0 Astronomy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Navigation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Curve 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mathematician 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Physics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Differential calculus is the process of finding out the rate of change of a variable compared to another variable It can be used to find the speed of a moving object or the slope of a curve figure out the maximum or minimum points of a curve or find answers to problems in the electricity and magnetism areas of physics among many other uses,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Variable 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electricity 0 Magnetism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Until calculus was invented the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
What Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope exactly using simple and logical rules They divided the curve into an infinity number of very small pieces They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in the slope approached a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve The particular value it approached was the actual slope,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infinity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The way to do this is to divide the graph into many very small pieces and then draw very thin rectangles under each piece As the rectangles become thinner and thinner the rectangles cover the area underneath the graph better and better The area of a rectangle is easy to calculate so we can calculate the total area of all the rectangles For thinner rectangles this total area value approaches the area underneath the graph The final value of the area is called the integral of the function,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Trees are rare on the tundra Only in the protected valleys or along the riverbanks are small trees able to grow Rivers come into the Arctic from the warmer south The places along their banks are a little bit warmer than the rest of the tundra and trees can grow there Otherwise only a few clusters of bushes grow sparingly Berry are the only fruit that grows in the Arctic,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Berry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Each summer the ice and snow melt allowing the animals to find food and the plants to flower The moisture from the snow stays toward the top of the ground s surface Plant roots can use it for their growth Even so in many places the soil is too poor for plant s growth Less than half of the tundra has plants growing on it,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tundra 0 0 0 0 0

The lemmings and voles are the rats and mice of the Arctic The lemmings have very short tails They live underground in summer Because the top soil freezes in the winter they cannot burrow underground then so they live under the snow during the colder months They eat plants and roots In a year with plenty of food millions of lemmings will be roaming the tundra The owls and foxes have more food than they can eat They will have more young in years when there are many lemmings However the tundra does not have enough food for millions of lemmings They rush across the tundra looking for food and are eaten by predators or starve to death Some try to swim across lakes or rivers and drown The few that remain continue to have families,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Roots 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tundra 0 Owls 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Caribou and their relative the reindeer also live in the Arctic The caribou are now found mostly in North America and they are larger than the reindeer Large herds feed on the grass and lichens When fall comes they move south to winter feeding grounds They dig through the snow with their sharp hoofs for food Their hollow fur creates a cushion of air around them that helps them to stay warm In the spring they return north to the summer pastures where their calves are born An hour or so after being born the calves are able to follow the herd toward the Arctic Ocean Most of the world s reindeer live in Europe and Asia Some of these reindeer are not wild They have been tamed by herdsmen who protect them from wolves and lead the migrations each spring and fall Also the musk ox which looks like a shaggy buffalo lives in the Arctic,Caribou 0 0 0 0 Reindeer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 North_America 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lichens 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Arctic_Ocean 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Europe 0 Asia 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Musk_Ox 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In an extremely northern part of Europe there is a place called Lapland It is not a country but parts of four countries The people who lived there are called Lapps by outsiders They call themselves Sami The Lapps of these four countries lived there long before the countries of Northway Sweden Finland and Russia were created There were several kinds of Lapp people Some lived by the ocean and lived mostly on fish Another group lived along the warmer rivers These people did a little farming hunting and fishing to live,0 0 0 0 0 0 Europe 0 0 0 0 0 Lapland 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
But the best known of the Lapp people were the nomads who raised reindeer The Lapps survived in their harsh homeland by domesticating the reindeer The Lapps were able to get everything they needed from the deer They ate mostly meat milk and cheese Their clothes were made froom reindeer skins and wool Their tents were also made from deer skins They are known for the beautifully decorated woolen clothing they made,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Reindeer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Wool 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The Lapps protected the herds moving with them as they migrated from summer to winter pastures They used trained reindeer to pull sleds carrying their supplies During the winter the herds moved south of the treeline The Lapps would live nearby in homes made of logs or sod The Lapps were very careful not to waste anything they got from the reindeer Milk was taken from the reindeer to drink or make cheese Meat was taken for food The blood was frozen in chunks and used for soup and pancakes Knives and belt buckles were carved from the bones and antlers The sinews were used as sewing thread Cleaned out stomachs were used to carry milk or cheese Every part of a dead reindeer was used,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cheese 0 0 0 0 0 0 Blood 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pancakes 0 0 Belt 0 0 0 0 0 Bones 0 Antlers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Winter clothing was made from layers of deer skin The inside layer would be worn with the fur facing in toward the person s skin The second layer was worn with the fur facing out Boots were also made of fur lined with grass that had been gathered during the short summer Every evening the grass would be taken out and dried by the fire so it would be ready to use again the next day Thus a Lapp could be warm and comfortable in even the coldest weather,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Today only a few of the Lapp people still follow the herds Those few use modern tools on their ancient migration They use snowmobiles to herd the reindeer and rifles to kill the wolves that chase them Even helicopters and radios are used to locate and move the reindeer Most of the Lapp people now live on small farms in one of the four nations of Lapland They raise crops and animals including a few reindeer to meet their needs The sale of reindeer meat is an important source of income for the Lapp people,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Eskimos are Arctic people too They sometimes ate raw meat Eskimos were also nomads but they did not have any animals except for dogs which they used for pulling their sleds and helping them hunt They were hunters and gatherers and they lived off on whatever they found or killed Like the Lapps though they were very careful to make good use of every part of the animals they killed Eskimos lived in tents during the summer and sod houses or igloos in the winter The Eskimos made very clever things from the bones antlers and wood they had They built different kinds of boats,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nomads 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The oil in Alaska for example is very important to the United States The main source is the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field on Alaska s north coast It was discovered in 1968 Plans were quickly made to build a pipeline to bring the oil to an ice free port so it could be shipped south Oil companies spent billions of dollars to build the Trans Alaska Pipeline in the mid 1970s It had to be built above the ground in the northern section because of the permafrost The warm oil in the pipes could have melted the permafrost and caused the ground to sink That would have broken the pipes and caused an oil spill The pipeline was completed in 1977 It brings oil to the seaport of Valdez  Alaska on Alaska s south coast From there the oil is taken by huge tankers to refineries along the west coast of the United States If you live in western America your family car may have Alaskan gasoline in its tank,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 United_States 0 0 0 0 0 Prudhoe_Bay_Oil_Field 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gasoline 0 0 0
Russia has more land in the Arctic than any other nation The Russian Arctic in Asia and the area just south of it are called Siberia It is such an empty harsh place that it has been used as a penal colony for many years The old Russian rulers and the modern communist Soviets would send criminals and people who disagreed to the government to live there However many people were also sent there to remove minerals harvest trees from forests and build city,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Asia 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Siberia 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Trees 0 Forests 0 0 City

The Arctic is also the shortest way for airlines to fly between some cities on different continents The flight from London to Tokyo for example is 1 400 miles shorter if flown across the top of the world instead of the old route south across Europe and Asia The polar route from San Francisco to Norway is several hours shorter than the same flight going across the United States and the Pacific Ocean,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 London 0 Tokyo 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Europe 0 Asia 0 0 0 0 San_Francisco 0 Norway 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pacific_Ocean

The aim of apartheid was to separate the people of South Africa into small independent nations The black ones were called Bantustans South Africa said they were independent countries and exchanged ambassadors but other countries did not The National Party of South Africa government did not want to spend a lot of money on this project They also wanted to keep the majority of South Africa s land for white people especially the richest places like the gold mines of Johannesburg They wanted black men to work in these mines for little money but their families had to live far away or face imprisonment,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Independent 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 National_Party_of_South_Africa 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Johannesburg 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Electric charges push or pull on each other if they are not touching This is possible because each charge makes an electric field around itself An electric field is an area that surrounds a charge At each point near a charge the electric field points in a certain direction If a positive charge is put at that point it will be pushed in that direction If a negative charge is put at that point it will be pushed in the exact opposite direction,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
It works like magnets and in fact electricity creates a magnetic field in which similar charges repel each other and opposite charges attract This means that if you put two negative close together and let them go they would move apart The same is true for two positive charges But if you put a positive charge and a negative charge close together they would pull towards each other A short way to remember this is the phrase opposites attract likes repel,0 0 0 Magnets 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In some materials electrons are stuck tightly in place while in other materials electrons can move all around the material Protons never move around a solid object because they are so heavy at least compared to the electrons A material that lets electrons move around is called a conductor A material that keeps each electron tightly in place is called an Insulator  Examples of conductors are copper aluminum silver and gold Examples of insulators are rubber plastic and wood Copper is used very often as a conductor because it is a very good conductor and there is so much of it in the world Copper is found in electrical wires But sometimes other materials are used,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Copper 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Inside a conductor electrons bounce around but they do not keep going in one direction for long If an electric field is set up inside the conductor the electrons will all start to move in the direction opposite to the direction the field is pointing A battery can make an electric field inside a conductor If both ends of a piece of wire are connected to the two ends of a battery the loop that was made is called an electrical circuit Electrons will flow around and around the circuit as long as the battery is making an electric field inside the wire This flow of electrons around the circuit is called electric current,0 0 0 Electrons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A conducting wire used to carry electric current is often wrapped in an insulator such as rubber This is because wires that carry current are very dangerous If a person or an animal touched a bare wire carrying current they could get hurt or even die depending on how strong the current was and how much electrical energy the current is transmitting You should be careful around electrical sockets and bare wires that might be carrying current,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
It is possible to connect an electrical device to a circuit so that electrical current will flow through a device This current will transmit electrical energy to make the device do something that we want it to do Electrical devices can be very simple For example in a light bulb current carries energy through a special wire called a filament which makes it glow Electrical devices can also be very complicated Electrical energy can be used to drive an electric motor inside a tool like a drill or a pencil sharpener Electrical energy is also used to power modern electronic devices including telephones computers and televisions,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Telephones 0 0 0

The gradient of a stream is a critical factor in determining its character and is entirely determined by its base level of erosion The base level of erosion is the point at which the stream either enters the ocean a lake or pond or enters a stretch in which it has a much lower gradient and may be specifically applied to any particular stretch of a stream In geologic terms the stream will erode down through its bed to achieve the base level of erosion throughout its course If this base level is low then the stream will rapidly cut through underlying strata and have a steep gradient and if the base level is relatively high then the stream will form a flood plain and meanders,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Erosion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Meanders are looping changes of direction of a stream These may be somewhat sine wave in form Typically over time the meanders don t disappear but gradually migration downstream However if some resistant material slows or stops the downstream movement of a meander a stream may erode through the neck between two legs of a meander to become temporarily straighter leaving behind an arc shaped body of water termed an oxbow lake or bayou A flood may also result in a meander being cut through in this way,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Migration 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Flood 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

There are different forms of government a state can have for example a republic or a monarchy Sometimes states form their own countries At other times many states work together to form a country Most states also have armed forces civil service law and police,0 0 0 0 0 Government 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Republic 0 0 Monarchy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Civil_Service Law 0 Police

More organized states could be monarchy such as early Egypt under the Pharaoh Following this were larger more military based states such as the Babylonian Empire or Roman Empire The most famous early states however were the Ancient Greek states which had freedom writing and a democracy,0 0 0 0 0 Monarchy 0 0 0 Egypt 0 0 Pharaoh 0 0 0 0 0 Military 0 0 0 0 0 Babylonian 0 0 Roman_Empire 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancient_Greek 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

These states all tried to improve their politics and economy and became more and more like the states today They formed proper frontier for their lands and worked with power within the state itself more such as the Church or the nobility They made army tax systems and embassy all to help make them more powerful and stability,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Church 0 0 Nobility 0 0 Army Tax 0 0 Embassy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Stability
Different states of the same category can also function differently For example two democratic states may be quite different if one has a well trained police or army while the other does not Therefore the word state only tells us what type of government that state follows and does not tell us about the country itself Bobbio Norberto 1989 Prentice Hall,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Police 0 Army 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A server is also a person who serves like a waiter at a restaurant or in a hotel,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Waiter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In net jargon a server is a computer that serves many kinds of information to or client machines Usually a server will only do a few things for many clients Every type of thing a server does is called a service Services are used by other computers that are called clients The relationship between client and server is called a client server relationship For example Wikipedia has Website servers which have a service for sending web pages over the Internet Your client computer talks to Wikipedia s web page service to get web pages for you A server can also host Video game ,0 Net_Jargon 0 0 0 0 Computer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Client 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Client Server 0 0 0 Wikipedia 0 Website 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Video_Game 0
So that servers and clients can talk to each other they need to be connected to a computer network and they need to use the same protocol In networks a protocol is a set way for machines to talk to other machines It is just like a language For example the Wikipedia server runs the HTTP to send web sites to your computer and your computer uses the HTTP Protocol to ask Wikipedia for pages,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Computer_Network 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Protocol 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 HTTP 0 0 0 0 0 Computer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Usually servers are specially made to be more powerful and reliable and they are much more expensive than normal computers Sometimes servers can be clustered which means that lots of servers work together to do one service,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The server might slow down if there are too many people accessing the server at the same time resulting in a high load It might also be unable to take the high load so it will automatically shut down,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Carl Sagan was born in Brooklyn New York City where his father Sam Sagan was a Jewish clothes maker and his mother Rachel Molly Gruber was a housewife Sagan attended the University of Chicago earning two degrees in physics He followed with a doctorate in Astronomy in 1960 and taught at Harvard University until 1968 when he moved to Cornell University,0 0 0 0 0 Brooklyn New_York_City 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Jewish 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 University_of_Chicago 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Harvard_University 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cornell_University
Sagan became a teacher and director at Cornell in 1971 He helped many unmanned spacecraft to explore outer space He thought of the idea of putting a message on spacecraft which could be understood by any life from another planet that might find it The first message sent into space was a large gold plated Pioneer plaque on the space probe Pioneer 10 He continued to make the messages better The last message he helped with was the Voyager Golden Record that was sent out with the Voyager program space probes,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Planet 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pioneer_plaque 0 0 0 0 Pioneer_10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Voyager_Golden_Record 0 0 0 0 0 0 Voyager_program 0 0
He was well known as a writer who warned of the dangers of nuclear winter He helped people learn about the atmosphere of Venus  seasonal changes on Mars  and Saturn s moon Titan  He showed that the atmosphere of Venus is very hot and dense He also said that global warming was a growing man made danger like the natural development of Venus  into a hot and dangerous planet with greenhouse gases He suggested that the seasonal changes on Mars were due to dust storms,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Global_Warming 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Sagan thought the search for life on other planets was a good idea He said scientists should listen with large radio telescopes for signals from other planets He thought sending probes to other planets was a good idea Sagan was editor Icarus for 12 years He helped start the Planetary Society and was a member of the SETI Institute Board of Trustees,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Sagan also believed that the Drake equation suggested that many kinds of intelligent life could form but that the lack of evidence suggests that intelligent beings destroy themselves rather quickly This made him keen to talk about ways that humanity could destroy itself in the hope of avoiding such destruction,0 0 0 0 0 Drake_equation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Not all scientists agreed with him Although they all liked the way he made science popular some were afraid that people would think that his personal opinions might be confused with real science What he said about the Kuwaiti oil fires during the first Gulf War were shown later to be wrong,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
After a long and difficult fight with myelodysplasia Sagan died of pneumonia at the age of 62 on December 20 1996 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle  Washington Sagan was very important because he made science popular and changed the way science was organized and because he defended humanism and argued against seeing things from only one point of view,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Myelodysplasia 0 0 0 Pneumonia 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Seattle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Humanism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Certain IP addresses can be assigned freely on the local area network Since they are not unique they are not routed on the internet The addresses which can be freely assigned are called private IP addresses the ones which are unique are called public To be routed a private address needs to be translated into a public one This process of translating between private and public addresses is called network address translation or NAT Router and Firewall  often also perform this task,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Router 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
There are different ways of getting a new IP address and not being blocked for vandalism anymore One of them is called Bootstrap Protocol The device that needs a new address does not know what network it is in so it uses an IP address of all zeroes which it sends as a broadcast to the current network on a special Network port In addition it sends the MAC address of the network card plus a 4 byte random number The BOOTP server will send a reply also as broadcast addressed to a different port The reply will contain the mac address of the client the random number and the IP address of the client When the client receives the data it will set the address specified If the BOOTP server is configured that way it will also send the IP address and hostname of the BOOTP Server the name and path to a file which should be loaded to boot the client or the name of a directory which the client should mount using NFS,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Network_port 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

IP addresses obtained automatically can be dynamic or static Static addressing means the same machine will always get the same IP address With dynamic addresses a device will get the next address which is not used Dynamic addresses which are used need to be reviewed from time to time If they are not renewed they can be used for other devices,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
With IPv4 each address consists of four 8 digit binary numbers called Octet An IPv4 address is 32 bits in total The biggest number one can make with 8 regular digits is 99 999 999 but the biggest number one can make with 8 binary digits is 255 so each octet can be any number from 0 to 255,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Octet 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Each octet is converted to its decimal form and separated by a period,0 0 0 0 0 0 Decimal 0 0 0 0 0 0
Also there are special meanings associated with two different ending numbers In general a last number of 0 stands for the network and a last number of 255 stands for all hosts on that network Computers that are on the same local network share 3 of the 4 numbers A computer can be on more than one network It can also have several names,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The problem with IPv4 is that it only allows for 4 3 billion addresses and we ve almost used them all To delay this Network address translation was created Network Address Translation has a network share one public IP address and give every computer on the network a private IP address Everyone living in the same house uses the same address but mail can be meant for multiple different people living in the house,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Network_address_translation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Most attempts are made in the summer because the days are long and the weather is good In the winter it is dark for most of the day and can be very cold The weather up the mountains can change very quickly and some people die in blizzards in the winter Most people who attempt the challenge use the same route because it is the easiest way of doing the challenge in 24 hours,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
They start with Ben Nevis at about five o clock It takes about three hours to climb this mountain so they reach the summit at about eight o clock and return to the bottom at about ten o clock In the summer it is still light in Britain at this time If people start climbing Ben Nevis too early they will arrive at Scafell Pike too early the next morning and it will still be dark It is important to be quick at the bottom of the mountains There is not much time so food is usually prepared by others waiting at the bottom When the climbers arrive they usually leave immediately and eat while they are on the road,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The next mountain is Scafell Pike in the Lake District of northern England The journey between Ben Nevis and Scafell Pike is longer than the journey between Scafell Pike and Snowdon This is why it is done at night when it is too dark to climb The journey takes six or seven hours and the walkers usually go to sleep The next morning they arrive at Scafell Pike at about half past four In the summer it is light by this time Scafell Pike is not as high as the other mountains but is harder,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lake_District 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

is a variant of the Liar paradox,0 0 0 0 0 Liar_paradox
A paradox is a seemingly absurd or self contradictory statement in logic that superficially cannot be true but also cannot be false Further analysis of the statement or proposition may reveal a fallacious axiom or some obscure underlying truth Not all paradoxes are fundamentally incongruous as some may only appear so Many famous problems of this kind exist,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Logic 0 0 0 0 True 0 0 0 0 False 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
If the sentence is a lie then it is not as it says it is true But that is just what the sentence says So that makes it true So the sentence being a lie makes it true,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This paradox is not just true in English but in any language powerful enough for a sentence to make a claim about itself This is true of mathematics as well Paradox can never be removed from any symbol system that makes claims about itself,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mathematics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Symbol 0 0 0 0 0 0

A monarchy is a kind of government where a monarch a kind of hereditary ruler is the head of state Monarchs usually rule until they die or pass down Most monarchies are hereditary but some are elected The most famous elected monarch is the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church Some well known titles for monarchs are King Queen Emperor Empress Czar Kaiser Shah Emir and Sultan,0 0 0 0 0 0 Government 0 0 Monarch 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pope 0 0 Roman_Catholic_Church 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 King Queen Emperor Empress Czar Kaiser Shah Emir 0 Sultan
Monarchy is one of the oldest kinds of government Most historians agree that the first monarchies were tribes or small groups of people who decided to let a war chief or other leader pass on their office to their children This created a dynasty Over time the rules for deciding who got to become the next monarch became more complicated Primogeniture is usual The oldest son or in some countries daughter becomes the next monarch when the old one dies,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dynasty 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Primogeniture 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Many monarchs today perform mostly the ceremonial jobs of a head of state while the head of government who is usually elected passes and enforces laws It is also very important in other parts of the country,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In an absolute monarchy the monarch is the only source of all laws The monarch has total power to make any law just by deciding it Any other institution in the country cannot make laws that affect the monarch unless the monarch decides to allow it Sometimes the monarch is also the head of the state religion and makes religious laws also All land and property in the country can be taken or given away by the monarch at any time for any reason The army and navy is under the personal control of the monarch and can be used for any purpose at any time The monarch can also pick who gets to be the next monarch and can change the rules at any time There is usually no elected government or Parliament and if there is one it has no real power This kind of government is very rare today The people do not have a lot of power in it,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Parliament 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A constitutional monarchy is a form of government that is usually a democracy and has a constitution with the monarch as head of state Either the monarch has to obey the laws like everyone else or if the monarch does not have to obey the same laws as the rest of the people there are special laws that say what the monarch can and cannot do The monarch usually can not decide their special laws on their own There may be laws about who the monarch s children can marry for example that are passed by the Parliament For example in the Netherlands if a member of the royal family marries without the permission of Parliament they cannot become king or queen themselves The army and navy may swear an oath to the monarch but the real power to control it is given to the elected government There are laws about property and succession that can only be changed by the elected government Usually the monarch must sign laws into effect but they are required to follow the will of the elected government,0 Constitutional_Monarchy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Democracy 0 0 0 Constitution 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Parliament 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A constitutional monarchy usually has separation of powers and the monarch often has only ceremonial functions such as representing the country while traveling or acting as a symbol for the whole country Constitutional monarchs usually do not vote even when it is legal for them to do so Voting would mean that they picked a side in political arguments and then could not claim to represent everyone in the country Some constitutional monarchies give the power to veto laws to the monarch but in most countries where this is the case it is a power that is very rarely used In countries where the monarch can dismiss or appoint governments this is usually only done to make sure that the democratic process is respected without taking sides in politics Appointments to public office made by constitutional monarchs are generally approved by the democratically elected government beforehand,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Veto 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Software packages in development are either uploaded to the project distribution named unstable or to the experimental repository Software packages uploaded to unstable are normally versions stable enough to be released by the original upstream  developer but with the added Debian specific packaging and other modifications introduced by Debian developers These additions may be new and untested Software not ready yet for the unstable distribution is typically placed in the experimental repository,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
After a version of a software package has remained in unstable for a certain length of time that package is automatically moved to the testing distribution The package s move to testing happens only if no serious bugs in the package are reported and if other software needed for package functionality qualifies for inclusion in testing,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Since updates to Debian software packages between official releases do not contain new features some choose to use the testing and unstable distributions for their newer packages However these distributions are less tested than stable and unstable does not receive timely security updates In particular incautious upgrades to working unstable packages can sometimes seriously break software functionality,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The oboe came from the shawm which was a medieval and Renaissance instrument It became popular in the Baroque music period Johann Sebastian Bach and Handel both used it in most of their orchestral music Many Italian composers such as Antonio Vivaldi wrote concertos for the instrument and it is used in a lot of chamber music At this time it hardly had any keys but gradually more keys were added which made it easier to play the sharps and flats,0 0 0 0 0 Shawm 0 0 0 Medieval 0 Renaissance 0 0 0 0 0 0 Baroque_music 0 Johann_Sebastian_Bach 0 Handel 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Antonio_Vivaldi 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Even though the media show this differently studies have shown that people with a severe mental illness are not necessarily violent Statistically violence is often caused by factors such as drug abuse or those related to the personal social and economic situation,0 0 0 Media 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
There are a few specific diagnoses which are defined by conduct problems and violence These include conditions such as childhood conduct disorder adult antisocial personality disorder or psychopathy There are conflicting findings about how much specific symptoms are linked to an increase in violent behaviour These symptoms include psychosis that can occur in disorders such as schizophrenia delusional disorder or mood disorder The factors that lead to violent behaviour are more often demographic or economic in nature such as being young male of lower socioeconomic status or of abusing drugs including alcoholism to which some people are particularly vulnerable,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Psychopathy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Psychosis 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Alcoholism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
High profile cases have led to fears that serious crimes such as homicide have increased because people with certain mental illnesses are not treated in specialized institutions but the evidence does not support this conclusion Violence that does occur in relation to mental disorder typically occurs in the context of complex social interactions often in a family setting rather than between strangers It is also an issue in health care settings and the wider community,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Homicide 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Hawking describes the motion of planets moving around the sun and how gravity works between the planets and the sun He also talks about the ideas of absolute rest and absolute position These ideas are about the thought that events stay in place over a period of time This was found not to be true by Newton s laws of gravity The idea of absolute rest did not work when objects move very fast,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The speed of light was first measured in 1676 by the Denmark astronomer Ole Christensen Roemer The speed of light was found to be very fast but at a speed However scientists found a problem when they tried to say that light always traveled at the same speed The scientists created a new idea called the ether which tried to explain light s speed,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Denmark Astronomer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Albert Einstein said the idea of the ether was not needed if another idea the idea of absolute time was dropped Einstein s idea was also the same as Henry Poincare s idea Einstein s idea is called the theory of relativity,Albert_Einstein 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Hawking also talks about light He says that events can be described by light cones The top of the light cone tells where the light from the event will travel The bottom tells where the light was in the past The center of the light cone is the event Besides light cones Hawking also talks about how light can bend When light goes past a big mass like a star the light changes direction slightly towards the mass,0 0 0 0 Light 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mass 0 0 0 0 0 0 Direction 0 0 0 0
After talking about light Hawking talks about time in Einstein s theory of relativity One prediction that Einstein s theory makes is that time will go by slower when something is near huge masses However when something is farther away from the mass time will go by faster Hawking used the idea of two twins living at different places to describe his idea If one of the twins went to live on a mountain and another twin went to live near the sea the twin who went to live on the mountain would be a little bit older than the twin who went to live at the sea,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Prediction 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Twins 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mountain 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The uncertainty principle says that the speed and the position of a particle cannot be found at the same time To find where a particle is scientists shine light at the particle If a high frequency light is used the light can find the position more accurately but the particle s speed will be unknown If a lower frequency light is used the light can find the speed more accurately but the particle s position will be unknown The uncertainty principle disproved the idea of a theory that was deterministic or something that would predict everything in the future,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Particle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Frequency 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Frequency 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Light waves have crests and troughs The highest point of a wave is the crest and the lowest part of the wave is a trough Sometimes more than one of these waves can interference with each other the crests and the troughs line up This is called light interference When light waves interfere with each other this can make many colors An example of this is the colors in soap bubbles,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Interference 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Particles with a spin of 0 1 or 2 move Force  from one particle to another Some examples of these particles are virtual gravitons and virtual photons Virtual gravitons have a spin of 2 and they represent the force of gravity This means that when gravity affects two things gravitons move to and from the two things Virtual photons have a spin of 1 and represent electromagnetic forces,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electromagnetic 0
Some scientists have tried to make a theory that combines the electromagnetic force the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force This theory is called a grand unified theory This theory tries to explain these forces in one big unified way or theory,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Black holes can be shaped differently Some black holes are perfectly sphere like a ball Other black holes bulge in the middle Black holes will be spherical if they do not rotate Black holes will bulge in the middle if they rotate,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sphere 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Black holes are difficult to find because they do not let out any light They can be found when black holes suck in other stars When black holes suck in other stars the black hole lets out X rays which can be seen by telescopes Hawking talks about his with another scientist Kip Thorne Hawking bet that black holes did not exist because he did not want his work on black holes to be wasted He lost the bet,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X Rays 0 0 0 0 0 Telescopes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Kip_Thorne 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Hawking realized that the event horizon of a black hole could only get bigger not smaller The area of the event horizon of a black hole gets bigger whenever something falls into the black hole He also realized that when two black holes combine the size of the new event horizon is greater than or equal to the sum of the event horizons of the two other black holes This means that a black hole s event horizon can never get smaller,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Disorder also known as entropy is related to black holes There is a scientific law that has to do with entropy This law is called the second law of thermodynamics and it says that entropy will always increase in an isolated system The relation between the amount of entropy in a black hole and the size of the black hole s event horizon was first thought of by a research student and proven by Hawking whose calculations said that black holes emit radiation This was strange because it was already said that nothing can escape from a black hole s event horizon,0 0 0 0 Entropy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Hawking also talks about how the universe could have been For example if the universe formed and then collapsed quickly there would not be enough time for life to form Another example would be a universe that expanded too quickly If a universe expanded too quickly it would become almost empty The idea of many universes is called the many worlds interpretation,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Each particle has many histories This idea is known as Feynman s theory of sum over histories A theory that unifies quantum mechanics and gravity should have Feynman s theory in it To find the chance that a particle will pass through a point the waves of each particle needs to be added up These waves happen in imaginary time Imaginary numbers when multiplied by themselves make a negative number For example 2i X 2i Other editions Notes References,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The second sometimes abbreviated sec is the name of a units of measurement of time It is one of the seven SI base units It is the time taken by 9 192 631 770 cycles of radiation that comes from electrons moving between two energy levels of the caesium 133 atom,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Units_Of_Measurement 0 Time 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Radiation 0 0 0 Electrons 0 0 0 0 0 0 Caesium 0 Atom

In 1956 the second was defined in terms of the period of revolution of the Earth around the Sun for a particular epoch  because by then it had become recognized that the Earth s rotation on its own axis was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time The Earth s motion was described in Newcomb s Tables of the Sun which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made between 1750 and 1892 The second thus defined is,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earth 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This definition was ratified by the Eleventh General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 The tropical year in the definition was not measured but calculated from a formula describing a tropical year which decreased linearly over time hence the curious reference to a specific instantaneous tropical year Because this second was the independent variable of time used in ephemeris of the Sun and Moon during most of the twentieth century it was called the ephemeris second,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ephemeris 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The ground state is defined at zero magnetic field The second thus defined is equivalent to the ephemeris second,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The revised definition would seem to imply that the ideal atomic clock would contain a single caesium atom at rest emitting a single frequency In practice however the definition means that high precision realizations of the second should compensate for the effects of the ambient temperature within which atomic clocks operate and extrapolate accordingly to the value of the second as defined above,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In one form or another slavery has been practiced since the earliest civilizations p 44 Early hunter gatherers had no use for slaves They did everything for themselves Having another pair of hands to help them meant another mouth to feed Slavery or owning another person made no sense to these people Once men gathered in cities and towns and there was more than enough food having a cheap supply of labor made sense This is when the earliest forms of slavery appeared Slavery can be traced back to the earliest records such as the Code of Hammurabi This refers to it as an established institution,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hunter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cities 0 Towns 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Code_of_Hammurabi 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The Winter Olympics were created for snow and ice sports that were not part of the Summer Games Figure skating and ice hockey were Olympic events at the Summer Olympics At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games A winter sports week was held in 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix France The IOC ruled that the Winter Olympic Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as the summer games This pattern continued until the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville France After this beginning with the 1994 Winter Olympics the Winter Olympics were held on the third year of each Olympiad,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lausanne 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1924_Winter_Olympics 0 Chamonix 0 0 0 0 0 0 Winter_Olympic_Games 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1992_Winter_Olympics 0 Albertville 0 0 0 0 0 0 1994_Winter_Olympics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A contract is an agreement or promise that the law can enforce The law will enforce some agreements but not others For example in most places if a parent promises to take a child to get ice cream the law will not enforce that promise as a legal contract,0 0 0 0 Agreement 0 Promise 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The legal rules about which promises are enforced by the law can be different in different places but a contract is usually enforced only if it is made by people or groups who want it to be enforced and who know what they are doing,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Sometimes a contract is writing down and signature by the agreeing to it but it does not always need to be People usually sign a contract when something important or costly is being done For example when people take a job they will sometimes sign a contract with their employers The contract will show what the person must do as part of his job how much they will be paid and so on The person and the employer will sign the contract and it will become a law promise,0 0 0 0 Writing 0 0 Signature 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Job 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Law Promise

The atoms of a chemical element can exist in different types These are called isotopes They have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons Different isotopes of the same element have different masses Mass is the word for how much substance something has Things with different masses have different weights Because different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons they do not all weigh the same or have the same mass,0 Atoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Protons 0 0 0 0 Neutrons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mass 0 0 0 0 0 0 Substance 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Different isotopes of the same chemical element have the same atomic number They have the same number of protons The atomic number is decided by the number of protons Isotopes have different mass numbers though because they have different numbers of neutrons,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Protons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Neutrons

Atomic nuclei are protons and neutrons held together by the nuclear force,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Because protons are positively charged they repel each other Neutrons which are neutral stabilize the nucleus Because they are in the nucleus the protons are pushed slightly apart This reduces the electrostatic repulsion between the protons They still exert the attractive nuclear force on each other and on protons One or more neutrons are necessary for two or more protons to bind into a nucleus As the number of protons increases so does the number of neutrons needed to have a stable nucleus,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The cosmological multiverse tries to explain why the universe we observe i e our universe seems so welcoming to the emergence of life Even small changes to the way physics works would make life impossible In a multiverse a vast number of universes are randomly created and some happen to favour life emerging there Many inhospitable universes would also have been created but there would be no life there to observe their existence,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Social capital is the willingness of people to help each other,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
It often replaces money which people would use to buy the same help,0 0 0 Money 0 0 0 0 0 Buy 0 0 0
Society works best when there is plenty of social capital The less social capital there is the more social problems there usually are If there is no social capital war and revolution often,Society 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 War 0 Revolution 0
People who have no money and cannot get help from society may have to agree to do things they do not want to do or force others to do things they do not want to Organized crime grows in this way and so do forced labour and slavery,0 0 0 0 Money 0 0 0 0 0 Society 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Organized_crime 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Slavery
Most ways of measure social capital have to do with people who trust that favours and help will be available when they need it will favour and help others more Those who are seen as trying to get a free ride will get much less help A social climber tries to earn social capital by making friends with those who have it but without actually helping Some call this kind of person a social parasite They are very hard to detect unlike people who or commit fraud When there are too many of these kinds of people especially when they are politicians people begin to their government Rather than work with a political party to change law they may start to look for direct for things,0 0 0 Measure 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Parasite 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fraud 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Politicians 0 0 0 0 Government 0 0 0 0 0 Political_Party 0 0 Law 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Social capital is a lot like real Capital  The more money a person or a society has the easier it is to do things and the better off people are The less money the more difficult things become and the worse people feel,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Creating is making new things that have not existed before usually by combining two or three things that existed Art is almost always called creative but so are other activities like music mathematics technology business craft building gardening and forestry if they combine things to get new things,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Art 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Music Mathematics Technology Business Craft Building Gardening 0 Forestry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When several people cooperate in more than one of creating that is a creative network This cuts risk since anything creative involves some chance that it will simply not work,0 0 0 Cooperate 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Creative_Network 0 0 Risk 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Most people fear change and new things and so what is most stable and considered important by society tends to be imitative and done in teams But unless society encourages creating it loses out to others by competition in business or technology so there must be some creative networks somewhere in labs or art studios,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Society 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Competition 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The radius of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side Mathematicians use the letter r for the length of a circle s radius The of a circle is the point in the very middle,0 Radius 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The diameter of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre of the circle Mathematicians use the letter d for the length of this line The diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius,0 Diameter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Both of these axes have tick marks along their lengths You can think of each axis as a ruler drawn on paper So each measurement is indicated by the length of the associated tick mark along the particular axis,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ruler 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Let s say you wanted to make a graph showing your height as you were growing up You might show your height in centimeters on the vertical axis and your age in years on the horizontal axis,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Centimeters 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
You would then plot 85 centimeters for year 2 and 95 centimeters for year 3 If you had more heights for more years you would plot years 4 5 and so forth When you had enough points on your graph you could draw a line through each of the plotted points making your graph a line graph For example the line graph at the upper right shows the unemployment rate on the vertical axis and the year on the horizontal axis,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Usually graphs are created on specially designed paper called graph paper This paper has evenly drawn horizontal and vertical lines on it On the right is an example of a sheet of graph paper,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Different types of graphs require different forms of graph paper What we have been talking about in the article above is the commonest form of graphs and graph paper It is known as rectangular or Cartesian coordinate system graphs However the evenly drawn vertical and horizontal lines on the paper are not the graph itself but are part of the graph paper The graph is the set of plotted points along with its axes,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cartesian_coordinate_system 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Huntingdon Life Sciences are the largest animal testing company in Europe They were founded in 1951 and are based in Huntingdon Cambridgeshire United Kingdom They also have a laboratory in New Jersey United States Huntingdon Life Sciences is an international contract research organisation offering a comprehensive range of non clinical development services The UK lab carries out medical and product research for many organisations,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Europe 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Huntingdon Cambridgeshire United_Kingdom 0 0 0 0 0 0 New_Jersey United_States 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Many people feel strongly against HLS The Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign group are the main opposition group SHAC were set up in 1999 The opposition to HLS has had many forms While most animal rights people have used legal means of protest some people have become extremists and done very bad things Thus the opposition to HLS has become an example to many people of a good cause gone wrong,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Extremists 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Poisons are Chemical substance which cause death or injury Exposure  Concise Oxford Dictionary 9th ed p1055 It may be taken in as drink or food or absorption through the skin The damage is usually done by a chemical reaction The effect of the poison varies with the amount which is absorbed Substances which are poisonous are called toxic If poisoning causes death it is lethal poison,0 0 Chemical_substance 0 0 Death 0 Injury 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Absorption 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Toxic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In medicine and zoology toxins and venoms are different from poisons Toxins are the result of a biological process Venom s are substances which the organism uses to harm other species Certain organisms use venoms for hunting or as a defense If an organism is poisonous such as many mushrooms it is harmful to eat If it is venomous like snakes or honeybees it has a harmful bite or sting For some very deadly bites humans have developed effective antivenoms,0 Medicine 0 Zoology 0 0 Venoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Organism 0 0 0 0 Species 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Often it is only the quantity of a substance that makes the difference Drinking alcoholic drinks may lead to aggressive behaviour problems with speech and different forms of amnesia This effect is called intoxication People who drink even more may go into Shock  At the same time alcohol can be used as a disinfectant,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Amnesia 0 0 0 0 Intoxication 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Disinfectant

In the the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition According to this definition noble gas atoms are considered molecules as they are in fact monoatomic molecules,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Particle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In gases like air the molecules are just flying around In liquids like water the molecules are stuck together but they can still move In solids like sugar the molecules can only vibrate In the fourth state of matter known as Plasma  the atoms are Ionization and cannot form molecules,0 Gases 0 Air 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Liquids 0 Water 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Solids 0 Sugar 0 0 0 0 Vibrate 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ionization 0 0 0 0
With a molecular formula you can write down the numbers of all atoms in a molecule For example the molecular formula of glucose is C 6 H 12 O 6 That means that one molecule of glucose is made up of six carbon atoms twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Glucose 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
For a molecule to exist atoms have to stick together This happens when two atoms share electrons Instead of circling just one atom the electron now circles around two This is called a covalent bond Sometimes more than one electron is shared The more electrons are shared the stronger the bond gets and the stronger the atoms stick together,0 0 0 0 0 Atoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electrons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Bonds can also be broken apart Since most bonds require energy to form they also give off energy when they are broken But before most bonds break the molecule has to be heated Then the atoms start to move and when they move too much the bond breaks Molecules that require less energy to break than they give off when broken are called fuels For example a candle will just sit there and nothing happens But when you use a match to light it it will burn for a long time The match brings the energy to break the first bonds which release enough energy to break the bonds below them until the candle has burned down,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A natural resource is what people can use which comes from the natural environment Examples of natural resources are air water wood Crude oil wind energy natural gas iron and coal,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Air Water Wood Crude_oil 0 Natural_Gas Iron 0 Coal
The dividing line between natural resources and man made resources is not clear cut Hydro electric energy is not a natural resource because people use turbines to convert the energy from moving water Petroleum and iron ores are natural but need work to make them into usable refined oil and steel Atomic energy comes from metallic nuclear fuel s like fissionable uranium and plutonium but natural rocks need technical work to make them into these nuclear fuels,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Petroleum 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Steel 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Uranium 0 Plutonium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A renewable resource is one which can be used again and again For example soil sunlight and water are renewable resources However in some circumstances even water is not renewable easily Wood is a renewable resource but it takes time to renew and in some places people use the land for something else Soil if it blows away is not easy to renew,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Soil Sunlight 0 Water 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Wood 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A non renewable resource is a resource that does not grow and come back or a resource that would take a very long time to come back For example coal is a non renewable resource When we use coal there is less coal afterward The non renewable resource can be used directly or we can find a renewable resource to use,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Coal 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some of the things influencing supply of resources include whether it is able to be Recycling and the availability of suitable substitutes for the material Non renewable resources cannot be recycled For example fossil fuels cannot be recycled,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Recycling 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Vitamin C is important in wound healing Without enough vitamin C a person can get a disease called scurvy Lack of vitamin C was a serious health problem on long ocean trips where supplies of fresh fruit were quickly used up Many people died from scurvy on such trips,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Disease 0 Scurvy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Vitamin C was first discovered in 1928 In 1932 it was proved to stop the sickness called scurvy,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Through history the need for people to eat fresh plant food to help them get through long sieges or long sea trips was known by some wise people but was often forgotten,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The first attempt to prove this idea was by a ship s doctor in the British Royal Navy called James Lind who at sea in May 1747 gave some crew members lemon juice as well as their normal ships food while others continued on normal food alone,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Royal_Navy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lemon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The results showed that lemons prevented the disease Lind wrote up his work and published it in 1753,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Lind s work was slow to be noticed In 1795 the British navy adopted lemon or lime juice as food for sailors,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lime 0 0 0 0 0
It was believed that only humans got scurvy but in 1907 Alex Holst and Theodore Frohlich two Norway chemists found that guinea pigs could also get it if not given fresh food,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Norway 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Scientists try to let reality speak for itself They support a theory when its predictions are confirmed and challenge it when its predictions prove false Scientific researchers offer hypotheses as explanations of phenomena and design experiments to test these hypotheses Since big theories cannot be tested directly it is done by testing predictions derived from the theory These steps must be repeatable to guard against mistake or confusion by any particular experimenter,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Experiments 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

There is no one scientific method Some fields of science are based on mathematical models such as physics and climate science Other fields such as many fields of social science have rough theories and rely more on patterns that emerge from their data Sometimes scientists focus on testing and confirming hypotheses but open ended exploration is also important Some scientific fields use laboratory experiments Others collect observations from real world situations Many areas of science are quantitative emphasizing numerical data and mathematical analysis But some areas especially in social science use qualitative methods such as interviews or detailed observations of human or animal behavior Focusing too much one kind of method can lead us to ignore knowledge produced using other methods,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Let s say we are going to find out the effect of temperature on the way sugar Solvation in a glass of water Below is one way to do this following the scientific method step by step,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Solvation 0 0 0 0 Water 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
One simple experiment would be to dissolve sugar in water of different temperatures and to keep track of how much time it takes for the sugar to dissolve This would be a test of the hypothesis that the of dissolving varies according to the kinetic energy of the solvent,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Test 0 0 Hypothesis 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Solvent
We want to make sure to use exactly the same amount of water in each trial and exactly the same amount of sugar We do this to make sure that the temperature alone causes the effect It might be for example that the ratio of sugar to water is also a factor in the rate of dissolving To be extra careful we might also run the experiment so that the water temperature does not change during the experiment,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
We will do the experiment in three trials which are exactly the same except for the temperature of the water,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
If every other part of the experiment was the same then this would be very good evidence that heat affects how fast sugar is dissolved,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The replication crisis refers to a crisis in science Very often the result of a Experiment is difficult or impossible to replication later either by independent researchers or by the original researchers themselves While the crisis has long standing roots the phrase was coined in the early 2010s as part of a growing awareness of the problem,0 0 0 0 0 0 Crisis 0 Science 0 0 0 0 0 0 Experiment 0 0 0 0 0 Replication 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

QM is a mathematics framework for much of modern physics and chemistry Quantum mechanics helps make sense of the smallest things in nature like protons neutrons and electrons Complex mathematics is used to study subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves because they act in very strange ways Quantum mechanics is important to physics and chemistry,0 0 0 Mathematics 0 0 0 0 0 Physics 0 Chemistry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Protons Neutrons 0 Electrons 0 Mathematics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Physics 0 Chemistry
Quantum is a Latin word that means how much So a quantum of energy is a specific amount of energy Light sources such as candles or lasers shoot out light in bits called photons Photons are like packets Each one has a certain little bit of energy,0 0 0 Latin 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lasers 0 0 0 0 0 0 Photons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Photons are particles much smaller than atoms and protons and electrons The more photons a lamp shoots off the brighter the light Light is a form of energy that behaves like the waves in water or radio waves The distance between the top of one wave and the top of the next wave is called a wavelength Each photon carries a certain amount or quantum of energy depending on its wavelength,0 0 Particles 0 0 0 Atoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Wavelength 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Wavelengths are not always so small Radio waves have longer wavelengths The wavelengths for an FM radio can be several meters in length Each photon has a certain amount of energy related to its wavelength The shorter the wavelength of a photon the greater its energy For example an ultraviolet photon has more energy than an infrared photon,0 0 0 0 0 0 Radio_waves 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 FM_radio 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Photon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional This means a longer wavelength will have a lower frequency and vice versa If the color of the light is infrared each photon can heat up what it hits So if a strong infrared lamp is pointed at a person that person will feel warm or even hot because of the energy stored in the many photons The surface of the infrared lamp may even get hot enough to burn someone who may touch it,0 0 Frequency 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infrared 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Humans cannot see infrared light but we can feel the radiation in the form of heat For example a person walking by a brick building that has been heated by the sun will feel heat from the building without having to touch it,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Heat 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract A mathematical function the wavefunction provides information about the probability amplitude of position momentum and other physical properties of a particle Many of the results of quantum mechanics are not easily visualized in terms of classical mechanics,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Quantum mechanics started when it was discovered that a certain frequency means a certain amount of energy Energy is proportional to frequency The higher the frequency the more energy a photon has and the more damage it can do Quantum mechanics later grew to explain the internal structure of atoms Quantum mechanics also explains the way that a photon can interference  with itself and many other things never imagined in classical physics,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Structure 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
or energy equals h times frequency This h is a number called Planck s constant after its discoverer,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Quantum mechanics is based on the knowledge that a photon of a certain frequency means a photon of a certain amount of energy Besides that relationship a specific kind of atom can only give off certain frequencies of radiation so it can also only give off photons that have certain amounts of energy,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Quantum mechanics formulas and ideas were made to explain the light that comes from glowing hydrogen The quantum theory of the atom also had to explain why the electron stays in its orbit which other ideas were not able to explain It followed from the older ideas that the electron would have to fall in to the center of the atom because it starts out being kept in orbit by its own energy but it would quickly lose its energy as it revolves in its orbit,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hydrogen 0 0 Theory 0 0 Atom 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electron 0 0 0 Orbit 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Hydrogen lamps work like neon lights but neon lights have their own unique group of colors of light Scientists learned that they could identify all elements by the light colors they produce They just could not figure out how the frequencies were determined,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In 1908 Walter Ritz made the Ritz combination principle that shows how certain gaps between frequencies keep repeating themselves This turned out to be important to Werner Heisenberg several years later,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Werner_Heisenberg 0 0 0
In 1905 Albert Einstein used Planck s idea to show that a beam of light is made up of a stream of particles called photons The energy of each photon depends on its frequency Einstein s idea is the beginning of the idea in quantum mechanics that all subatomic particles like electrons protons neutrons and others are both waves and particles at the same time This led to a theory about subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves called wave particle duality This is where particles and waves were neither one nor the other but had certain properties of both,0 0 Albert_Einstein 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Photons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Frequency 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electrons Protons Neutrons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
There is some law that says what frequencies of light glowing hydrogen will produce It has to predict spaced out frequencies when the electrons involved are moving between orbits close to the nucleus of the atom but it also has to predict that the frequencies will get closer and closer together as we look at what the electron does in moving between orbits farther and farther out It will also predict that the intensity  differences between frequencies get closer and closer together as we go out Where classical physics already gives the right answers by one set of equations the new physics has to give the same answers but by different equations,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The rule says that when the electron moves from one orbit to another it either gains or loses energy depending on whether it is getting farther from the center or nearer to it So we can put these orbits or energy levels in as headings along the top and the side of a grid For historical reasons the lowest orbit is called n and the next orbit out is called n a then comes n b and so forth It is confusing that they used negative numbers when the electrons were actually gaining energy but that is just the way it is,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Einstein argued that over such a great distance it was crazy to think that forcing one electron to show its spin would then somehow make the other electron show an opposite characteristic He said that the two electrons must have been spin up or spin down all along but that quantum mechanics could not predict which characteristic each electron had Being unable to predict only being able to look at one of them with the right experiment meant that quantum mechanics could not account for something important Therefore Einstein said quantum mechanics had a big hole in it Quantum mechanics was incomplete,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In 1925 Werner Heisenberg described the Uncertainty principle which says that the more we know about where a particle is the less we can know about how fast it is going and in which direction In other words the more we know about the speed and direction of something small the less we can know about its position Physicists usually talk about the momentum in such discussions instead of talking about speed Momentum is just the speed of something in a certain direction times its mass,0 0 0 0 0 0 Uncertainty_principle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Speed 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Position 0 0 0 0 0 Momentum 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mass
The reason behind Heisenberg s uncertainty principle says that we can never know both the location and the momentum of a particle Because light is an abundant particle it is used for measuring other particles The only way to measure it is to bounce the light wave off of the particle and record the results If a high energy or high frequency light beam is used we can tell precisely where it is but cannot tell how fast it was going This is because the high energy photon transfers energy to the particle and changes the particle s speed If we use a low energy photon we can tell how fast it is going but not where it is This is because we are using light with a longer wavelength The longer wavelength means the particle could be anywhere along the stretch of the wave,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The principle also says that there are many pairs of measurements for which we cannot know both of them about any particle no matter how hard we try The more we learn about one of such a pair the less we can know about the other,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Particle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Electrons surround every atom s nucleus Chemical bonds link atoms to form molecules A chemical bond links two atoms when electrons are shared between those atoms Thus QM is the physics of the chemical bond and of chemistry QM helps us understand how molecules are made and what their properties are For a good foundation see The Nature of the Chemical Bond by Linus Pauling,Electrons 0 0 Atom 0 0 Chemical_bonds 0 0 0 0 Molecules 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chemistry 0 0 0 0 0 Molecules 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

QM is the part of physics that can explain why all electronics works as it does Thus QM explains how computers work because computers are electronic machines But the designers of the early computer hardware of around 1950 or 1960 did not need to think about QM The designers of radios and televisions at that time did not think about QM either However the design of the more powerful integrated circuits and computer memory technologies of recent years does require QM,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electronics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Computers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

One example is Young s double slit experiment If we shoot single photons from a laser at a sheet of we will see a single spot of light on the developed film If we put a sheet of metal in between and make two very narrow slits in the sheet when we fire many photons at the metal sheet and they have to go through the slits then we will see something remarkable All the way across the sheet of developed film we will see a series of bright and dark bands We can use mathematics to tell exactly where the bright bands will be and how bright the light was that made them that is we can tell ahead of time how many photons will fall on each band But if we slow the process down and see where each photon lands on the screen we can never tell ahead of time where the next one will show up We can know for sure that it is most likely that a photon will hit the center bright band and that it gets less and less likely that a photon will show up at bands farther and farther from the center So we know for sure that the bands will be brightest at the center and get dimmer and dimmer farther away But we never know for sure which photon will go into which band,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Adding heat to something increases its temperature but heat is not the same as temperature The temperature of an object is a measure of the average speed of the moving particles in it The energy of the particles is called the internal energy When an object is heated its internal energy can increase to make the object hotter The first law of thermodynamics says that the increase in internal energy is equal to the heat added minus the Work  done on the surroundings,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Temperature 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Average 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Energy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The measure of how much heat is needed to cause some change in temperature for a material is the specific heat capacity of the material If the particles in the material are hard to move then more energy is needed to make them move quickly so a lot of heat will cause a small change in temperature A different particle that is easier to move will need less heat for the same change in temperature,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The Gospels say that many years before Jesus birth prophets had told a promise to the Jewish people that God would send them a Messiah or holy teacher Christians believe that the promised Messiah was Jesus His mother was a young woman called Mary who was engaged but not yet married to a carpenter called Joseph Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant and was upset He was wondering what he should do when an angel came from God to tell him that the baby was the Holy One The angel said that he must name the baby This was a sign that he would take care of it like his own child,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Prophets 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Messiah 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Carpenter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pregnant 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Before the 4th century AD Christians could only worship and celebrate in secret The feast of Christmas probably began while Constantine I  was the Emperor of Rome because it was he who made Christianity a legal religion and built some of Rome s oldest churches Some old stone coffins or sarcophagi from this time are carved with pictures of Madonna and Child and the Three Wise Men,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Madonna_and_Child 0 0 Three_Wise_Men

Dental floss is a special type of thread It is used for cleaning spaces between Tooth which cannot be reached by toothbrushes It is important to floss before brushing teeth and to floss at least once a day Tooth brushing will not clean food that is packed between teeth This food packing can lead to unhealthy teeth and gums Bacteria grow in this packed food between teeth These bacteria cause the surface of teeth to break down Then the teeth and gums and sometimes even the jaw can become seriously diseased,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Thread 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tooth 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bacteria 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Food that is trapped between the teeth can be uncomfortable and even cause pain Some food is hard for example meat apple Ground meat is soft and so is apple sauce Chicken and turkey meat are hard and full of fibres and very often get trapped between the teeth When hard food is trapped between the teeth it can cause discomfort and sometimes pain When hard food is pressed by the teeth against the gum it can cause pain Some people use toothpicks to try to remove trapped food from between the teeth and other people use dental floss to do this,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Dental floss can do most things that a toothpick can do but dental floss is much thinner than a toothpick and can thus get to places that most toothpicks cannot reach So floss presumably does a better job at getting bits of food out from between the teeth relieving discomfort and pain quicker,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When a person first starts flossing bleeding can happen This is normal and happens because teeth and gums that are not flossed are less healthy It will stop as the teeth and gums get healthier with flossing,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The elephant would step upon the head of the condemned the one commanded to die Usually handlers trained the elephant to put its large foot gently on the person s head At this point witnesses looked under the elephant s foot to make sure the prisoner was the one who committed the crime Often the condemned would scream and beg the witnesses to say it was not him If a witness stated this was not the criminal they would probably commit perjury Perjury means lying at a trial In those days rulers could punish perjury with death Few witnesses denied the condemned was the criminal because then the elephant may crush them instead Then the mahout or elephant driver gave the order and the elephant would push down with its weight The skull broke and the foot crushed the head flat,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Perjury 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mahout 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Different regions crushed people by elephant in different ways One region put people inside of a bag so they would not have to watch what was about to happen Then the elephant would crush the bag flat with the condemned inside In another region people made the condemned watch the elephant slowly come from far away Its huge feet kept coming closer Sometimes they buried the condemned to the neck The elephant would come and step on the head Some places made the condemned put his head on a special stand The stand had fountains on the sides where brains and blood would flow when the elephant pressed down its huge foot,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A thermometer is an instrument for measuring or showing temperature One type of thermometer is a narrow concealed glass tube containing mercury or alcohol which extends along the tube as it expands Another type is a digital thermometer which uses electronics to measure temperature,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Temperature 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Early thermometers measured the expansion and contraction of air After the middle 17th century many used alcohol or mercury In the 19th century a mechanical thermometer was in invented that used a bimetallic strip to move a pointer This kind is still popular where people like to read temperature from a distance,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A laboratory thermometer is a tool used in laboratories to measure temperature with high accuracy It can be partially or fully immersed in the substance being measured A laboratory thermometer is recognizable by its long stem with a silver bulb at the end The silver color in the bulb normally indicates the presence of mercury Mercury expands as the temperature increases thus raising the reading while decreasing temperatures contract the mercury lowering the reading Mercury in glass thermometer s are less used in the 21st century as preference is shifted to other types of thermometers such as digital alcohol filled and organic based thermomerteus,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mercury 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

It is only possible to find oral temperatures on patients who can hold the thermometer correctly in their mouth So small children cannot use this method It is also a problem for people with a cough or people who are vomiting In the past it was a big problem because mercury thermometers needed a long time to measure the temperature Today s digital thermometers are faster If a person drinks something hot or cold one still needs to wait before testing their oral temperature,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vomiting 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

There are large earthquakes and small earthquakes Large earthquakes can take down buildings and cause death and injury Earthquakes are measured using observations from seismometers The magnitude of an earthquake and the intensity of shaking is usually reported on the Richter scale The Richter Scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter in 1935 On the scale 2 is scarcely noticeable and magnitude 5 causes damage over a wide area,0 0 Large 0 0 Small 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Richter_Scale 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
An earthquake under the ocean can cause a tsunami This can cause just as much death and destruction as the earthquake itself Landslides can happen too Earthquakes are part of the Earth s rock cycle The impact can be measured by a seismometer It detects the vibrations caused by an earthquake It puts these movement on a seismograph The strength or magnitude of an earthquake is measured using the Richter scale The Richter scale is numbered 0 9 Now the largest ever measured is 9 5,0 0 0 0 Ocean 0 0 0 Tsunami 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earth s crust The main cause is when Plate tectonics ride one over the other causing orogeny and severe earthquakes,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Plate_tectonics 0 0 0 0 0 0 Orogeny 0 0 0
The boundaries between moving plates form the largest Fault  surfaces on Earth When they stick motion between the plates leads to increasing stress This continues until the stress rises and breaks suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault This releases the Potential energy as shock wave s The San Andreas Fault in San Francisco and Great Rift Valley fault in Africa are faults like this,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Potential_Energy 0 0 0 0 San_Andreas_Fault 0 San_Francisco 0 Great_Rift_Valley 0 0 Africa 0 0 0 0
Most earthquakes form part of a sequence related to each other in terms of location and time Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A foreshock is an earthquake that occurs before a larger earthquake called the mainshock,0 Foreshock 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake the mainshock An aftershock is in the same region of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude Aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock,0 Aftershock 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Aftershock 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock therefore none have notably higher magnitudes than the other An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Yellowstone_National_Park
Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in a sort of earthquake storm where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault these storms occur over the course of years and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones Such a pattern occurred in the North Anatolian fault in Turkey in the 206666th century,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Turkey 0 0 0 0

Earthquake proof buildings are constructed to withstand the destructive force of an earthquake This depends upon its type of construction shape mass distribution and Different combinations are used Square rectangular and shell shaped buildings can withstand earthquakes better than skyscrapers To reduce stress a building s ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid hollow columns while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns inside the hollow columns Another method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground allowing the columns to shake parallel to each other during an earthquake,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mass 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Skyscrapers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Congress has specified that a Federal Reserve Bank must hold collateral equal in value to the Federal Reserve notes that the Bank receives This collateral is chiefly gold certificates and United States securities This provides backing for the note issue The idea was that if the Congress dissolved the Federal Reserve System the United States would take over the notes This would meet the requirements of Section 411 but the government would also take over the assets which would be of equal value Federal Reserve notes represent a first lien on all the assets of the Federal Reserve Banks and on the collateral specifically held against them,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In a country whose system of government is a monarchy the ruler or head of state is decided by inheritance That is when a ruler dies their child or nearest relative takes over For much of history most countries were governed in this way especially in Europe Some countries elect their monarch instead of using inheritance like the Holy Roman Empire and Malaysia,0 0 Country 0 0 0 Government 0 0 Monarchy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Inheritance 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 History 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Holy_Roman_Empire 0 Malaysia
Many people do not think it is good to have a Monarchy because it is not elected though some people in countries such as the UK want to keep their royal family as they have remained a traditional icon and source of income for the country However in the UK their influence in the rule of the country is incredibly limited and democracy is left primarily to the governing party elected by the people,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Plasma is created by adding energy to a gas so that some of its electrons leave its atoms This is called ionization It results in negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions Unlike the other states of matter the charged particles in a plasma will react strongly to electric and magnetic fields If a plasma loses heat the ions will re form into a gas emitting the energy which had caused them to ionize,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ionization 0 0 0 0 0 Electrons 0 0 0 Ions 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The theory of evolution says that all living things on Earth including plants animals and microbes come from a common ancestor by slowly changing throughout the generations Darwin suggested that the way living things changed over time is through natural selection This is the better survival and reproduction of those that best fit their environment Fitting into the place where you live is called adaptation Those who fit best into the place where they live the best adapted have the best chance to survive and breed Those who are less well adapted tend not to survive If they do not survive well enough to raise young this means they do not pass on their genes In this way the species gradually changes,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancestor 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Environment 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Adaptation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Genes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Darwin noticed that although young plants or animals are very similar to their parents no two are exactly the same and there is always a range of shape size colour and so on Some of these differences the plant or animal may have got from their own ancestors but some are new and caused by mutations When such differences made an organism more able to live in the wild it would have a better chance to survive and would pass on its genes to its offspring and they to their offspring Any difference that would cause the plant or animal to have less of a chance to live would be less likely to be passed on and would eventually die out altogether In this way groups of similar plants or animals slowly change in shape and form so that they can live more successfully and have more offspring who will survive them So natural selection had similarities to selective breeding except that it would happen by itself over a much longer time,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mutations 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Genes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup of holy water near the entrance of the church This tradition comes from the fact that Roman basilicas had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance The font is a bowl where people are baptism This is also near the entrance of the church This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Font 0 0 0 0 0 0 Baptism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Traditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on These are called pews Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions At the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest preaches There is also a lectern from where the lessons are read,0 0 0 0 0 Benches 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lectern 0 0 0 0 0 0
If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be column which hold up the roof In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars This is called the triforium Over the triforium is the clerestory which is a row of windows high up in the church wall,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Column 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The chancel is the most holy part of the church and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone or occasionally iron The congregation can see through the screen On the top of the screen there may be a cross This is called a rood screen Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the epistle and the gospel Sometimes people sang from there,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Epistle 0 0 Gospel 0 0 0 0 0

In the 1600s churches were built in a variety of styles Often they copied some of the older styles After the Great Fire of London many new churches were built by the architect Sir Christopher Wren They were built in the classical style Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this but also the Gothic style continued to be used,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Great_Fire_Of_London 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Christopher_Wren 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Modern churches often do not have the traditional cross shape It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel Modern churches bring the congregation choir and priests in closer touch An example is the round design for the Church of Christ the Cornerstone  Milton Keynes in Milton Keynes Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches Many have beautiful mosaic glass windows Coventry Cathedral is a famous example of a modern church building,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Milton_Keynes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mosaic 0 0 Coventry_Cathedral 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Gothic architecture are building designs as first pioneered in Western Europe in the Middle Ages It began in France in the 12th century The Gothic style grew out of Romanesque architecture It lasted until the 16th century By that time the Renaissance architecture of architecture had become popular The important features of Gothic architecture are the pointed arch the ribbed vault the flying buttress and stained glass windows which are explained below,0 Architecture 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Europe 0 0 Middle_Ages 0 0 0 France 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Romanesque_architecture 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Renaissance_architecture 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vault 0 0 Buttress 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Before the 20th century the landmark building in almost every town was a church cathedral abbey or town hall with its tall tower or spire rising high above all the houses Many of these buildings were from the Middle Ages and were Romanesque or Gothic in style Nikolaus Pevsner An Outline of European Architecture,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The groundplan of most Gothic churches is shaped like a cross The long nave makes the body of the church and crossing it the arms are called the transept On the other side of the transept is the chancel which is often called the choir because that is where the priest and the choir sing the services,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The nave usually has a passageway or aisle on either side Sometimes there are two aisles on each side The nave is usually a lot taller than the aisles and has high windows which light up the central space The upper part of the building where these windows are is called the clerestory,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Large Gothic churches and cathedrals are often very tall On the inside the nave is usually at least twice as high as it is wide which gives the church a very tall narrow look Some of the churches in France and Germany have naves that are three times as high as they are wide Cologne Cathedral is an example The tallest nave is at Beauvais Cathedral which is 157 5 feet high Westminster Abbey is 102 feet high,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cologne_Cathedral 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Beauvais_Cathedral 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
On the outside most Gothic churches both big and small have at least one tower In Italy there are domes on the churches and the tower stands to one side But in most other countries cathedrals generally have two towers and quite often have three Some have even more Laon Cathedral was planned to have seven but they were not all built,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Laon_Cathedral 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Because a pointed arch points upwards it makes people look upwards In Gothic architecture the whole building is designed to make people look up There are long narrow columns long narrow windows and high pointed roofs On the inside the arches of the roof rise up like branches On the outside there are often lots of fancy bits along the edge of the roof and on the tops of buttresses and above the windows These are called pinnacles Milan Cathedral has hundreds of them,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Milan_Cathedral 0 0 0 0

The flying buttresses which arch across the roof of the aisle were used to support the roof above the windows so the walls did not have to be so thick,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The columns of the inside the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses made a strong stone skeleton in between these parts the walls and the filling of the vaults could be of lighter thinner material Between the narrow buttresses the walls could be opened up into large windows,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Through the Gothic period because of the pointed arch Gothic windows were able to change from simple openings to very rich designs The windows were very often filled with stained glass which made coloured light in the building and was used for story telling pictures,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Stained_Glass 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In humans the sex of a person depends on what sex chromosomes that person got from his or her parents A woman s ovum contains one X chromosome A man s sperm contains either an X or a Y chromosome When a sperm and ova combine to form a fertilised egg the baby may get either of these chromosomes from its father If the baby gets two X chromosomes it will develop into a female If the baby gets one X and one Y it will develop into a male,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chromosomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In sexual reproduction the cells used for reproduction called gametes are either eggs or sperms Fertilisation needs two different such cells The mechanism of cell division only works when one sperm alone enters the egg Once it is in a fast reaction goes through the egg cell wall to shut off all other sperm,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gametes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In most cases there are separate sexes This means that an organism either produces male gametes or eggs but not both at the same time The biological cause for an organism developing into one sex or the other is called sex determination,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Usually sex is determined by an organism s genes With genetic sex determination most alleles or genes that influence sexual development are on the same chromosome That chromosome is then called the sex chromosome Because genetic sex determination is controlled by a pair of sex chromosomes there are usually the same number of male and female offspring In humans for instance sperms carry either an X or a Y chromosome and they occur in roughly equal numbers,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Genes 0 0 0 0 0 Alleles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chromosome 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Death is the end of life in an organism All Biology and living activity of the living thing stop including the mind and the sensory systems The usual Signs and symptoms for death in humans and many other animals is that the heart stops beating and cannot be restarted This can be caused by many things All living things have a limited lifespan and all living things eventually die,0 0 0 0 0 Life 0 0 Organism 0 Biology 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mind 0 0 0 0 0 Signs_and_symptoms 0 0 0 Humans 0 0 0 Animals 0 0 0 Heart 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Living things that have died are normally described as being dead Death of humans is often investigated for the cause in case of crime accident or disease that may continue to kill other humans About 150 000 people die every day around the world About two thirds of these people die because of ageing In addition to the physical body some believe humans also have a soul and believe that the soul can continue without a body move into another body or cease to exist Religions have different beliefs about this issue Many cultures have their own customs and rituals to respect the dead,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Crime Accident 0 Disease 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ageing 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Soul 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Religions 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Customs 0 0 0 0 0 0
When people talk about things or events that lead to the death of a plant or animal those things or events are usually described as being deadly or fatal In the case of diseases they are described as terminal Humans are no different from any other lifeform Our bodies have an ability for self repair but that ability is limited Finding the cause of death is a medical speciality called pathology In medicine death is when the heart stops beating for more than several minutes There are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for 30 minutes such as near drowning in very cold water If machines are used to help the heart and lungs work then the moment of death is more difficult to know,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pathology 0 Medicine 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Death is commonly a sad or unpleasant thing to people It can make people think about their own death People might miss or be sad for the person who has died They might also be sad for the family and friends of the person who has died,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In any society human death is surrounded by ritual a Funeral or funeral is normal In some places it was common to eat the dead in a form of ritual cannibalism But this is no longer common in part because disease like Kuru  can be passed this way Human dead bodies are taboo in most societies and must be handled in special ways for a combination of religious and hygiene reasons A human dead body must always be reported in law to be sure it is disposed of properly,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ritual 0 Funeral 0 Funeral 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ritual Cannibalism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Disease 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Taboo 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hygiene 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Law 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Finding the cause of any human death and stopping a similar death from happening to someone else are the main reasons people look into human morbidity or let dead bodies be cut open and looked at in an autopsy Some religions do not allow autopsies because they feel the body is holy Autopsies are usually required by the state if someone dies and people do not know why The autopsy helps find out if someone killed the person on purpose tried to hurt them or if they died from a sickness,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Autopsy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 State 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
To prepare for their own death humans can write a last will and testament to be clear about who gets their property and possessions A person will sometimes also volunteer to be an organ donor This might mean giving the whole body to medical research It can also save the lives of others by making organ transplants possible,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Property 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
For a long time many people have been afraid of death and a lot of people have wondered about what may happen to people after they die This is one of the largest questions of philosophy and religion Many people believe there is some form of afterlife,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Philosophy 0 Religion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Afterlife
Ancient rulers sometimes did insist not only that their own bodies and much property but even their servants and relatives be destroyed at their funeral In India this ritual still does sometimes occur Old women sometimes carry guns in case their husband s relatives come to throw them on the funeral fire,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 India 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Every ethical tradition including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death Often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual For instance one may say that organ transplant is like cannibalism,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cannibalism
Very much of what happens at a human death is ritual People who wish theirs to be dealt with a certain way and who wish a particular treatment like cremation of their body should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements This makes it much easier for their family after they die since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cremation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience a person can no longer communicate for themselves can be exchanged by others,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Because events leave living memory and may only be part of oral tradition there are projects to record everything that people remember about World War I and the Shoah The first of these was to record everything remembered about the U S  Civil War This discipline has changed history since we have so many more first person accounts of the times and made social history much more standard,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 World_War_I 0 0 Shoah 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 U 0 0 0 0 0 0 History 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Copyright laws usually protect owners of copyright beyond their lifetime In some countries such as Canada and New Zealand works are protected for 50 years after the author dies In other countries like the United States and the United Kingdom the protection lasts for 70 years after death When the period of copyright protection has ended the written document musical composition book picture or other creative work is in the public domain This means that no one owns the copyright and everyone is free to copy use and change them without having to ask for permission or pay the owner,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Canada 0 New_Zealand 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 United_States 0 0 United_Kingdom 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Some people argue that copyright laws make it easier for people to make new works and think of new ideas After all if authors get to make money for the time effort and money they put in then they will want to make more works later and make more money,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

If an author wants to sell a work it s often easiest to give the copyright to a publisher The publisher will do all the selling and in return for that service will keep part of the money But the publisher has many different things to sell and they may not want to sell the work the author made Authors often find it very hard to find a publisher willing to sell their work,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
But without a publisher it can be even harder for an author to sell his or her work In many markets a few big publishers own the copyrights to almost everything available and stores will not want to sell works published by small authors themselves Many people say copyright law helps big publishers stay in control and keeps smaller authors out of the market,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Markets 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Pedipalps are the two appendages on the front of a spider s head Some spiders seem to have ten legs and not eight because these pedipalps look like an extra pair of legs The pedipalps are used rather like arms Spiders often use them to hold insects for them to eat,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Spider 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Legs 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Insects 0 0 0 0
Male spiders also use pedipalps for mating The male spiders make some silk put sperm onto the silk and then put their pedipalps into the sperm The pedipalps then hold the sperm and the spider can use it to mate with a female by putting them inside her epigynum,Male 0 0 0 0 0 Mating 0 0 0 0 0 Silk 0 Sperm 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Female 0 0 0 0 0 Epigynum

The Cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god They believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world but inside their bodies there was a spirit and that spirit needed to return to the good god They were famous for a belief in a form of reincarnation and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that person s spirit in a new body They believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing They were opposed to the doctrine of sin,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Reincarnation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sin

In the South of France there was tremendous religious fervor and an economy that was starting to grow and a social class of merchants and peasants was starting to grow Peasants owned their own land Meanwhile in other parts of Europe peasants were forced to give up their land to nobles and become serfs or slaves the system of feudalism There was a strong central absolute monarchy that did not exist in the South of France The burghers and bankers had more power in this looser system R  I  Moore is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Economy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Land 0 0 0 0 0 Europe 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nobles 0 0 Serfs 0 Slaves 0 0 0 Feudalism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 R 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Taxonomy is a branch of science It is about the laws and principles of classifying things Oxford English dictionary From one type of taxonomy many classifications might be produced,0 0 0 0 0 Science 0 0 0 0 Laws 0 Principles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The best known kind of taxonomy is used for the Biological classification of lifeforms Each organism has a scientific name This name is part of the biological classification of that species The name is the same all over the world so scientists from different places can understand each other In addition a species has a position in the Tree of life  Thus the crow is Corvus corone a member of the Corvidae Family  and they are passerine birds That is well agreed but the classification of some groups is not agreed at present and often several classifications are being discussed,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Biological_classification 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Species 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Crow 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Corvidae 0 0 0 0 Passerine Birds 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When someone writes about a living thing and its formal scientific name they write the genus and species name This is known as binomial nomenclature because it uses two names for each organism The first is the genus name and the second is the species in that genus The scientific name of the domestic cat is Felis catus Sometimes it is enough to write F catus,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Organism 0 0 0 0 Genus 0 0 0 0 0 0 Species 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

When people started naming species Latin language was a language widely used in Europe All species names are still written in Latin This has some advantages Since Latin is no longer spoken it is unchanging and is owned by no one It gets over the problem of every language having its own names for animals and plants,0 0 0 0 0 Latin_Language 0 0 0 0 0 0 Europe 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

An important modern approach to taxonomy is Clade This approach is based on the branching course of evolution Like traditional Linnaeus classification it uses traits to decide on the branches of the classification It insists on groups being monophyletic This has the effect that birds are not a class but a sub group of dinosaurs It also means the ranking system described above would be abolished,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Clade 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Evolution 0 0 Linnaeus 0 0 0 Traits 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Monophyletic 0 0 0 0 0 Birds 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dinosaurs 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
So cladism has different principles of taxonomy and produces a different kind of taxonomy Decisions where possible are supported by DNA sequence analysis Present day biological classification is a mixture of the old Linnaean and the modern cladistic principles of taxonomy In parts it is changing rapidly The classifications presented in Wikipedia at present are often a compromise between the two systems The details are regularly discussed,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dna 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Financial capital is a form of capital  It is things that have value but do not do anything by themselves They are only valuable because people value them For example money is a form of financial capital You cannot do anything with money but it still has value,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Value 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Money 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Financial capital is used to pay for things this is because there is always more of it and people always want it This means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some forms of financial capital such as stocks gold or bond s are not wanted by everybody However they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital Because of this these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price This means that some people try to make a profit by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a market,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gold 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Profit 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Market
Some things are treated as financial capital even though they do have a use For example some people buy and sell land but are not interested in doing anything with it Some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money Other types of capital such as social capital and human capital are rarely treated like financial capital This may be because they involve people Treating useful capital like financial capital is called comodification,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Land 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Social_Capital 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

You should notice that some of the verb forms look the same You can say they have the same shape For example the plain present and the plain form of walk have the same shape The same is true for the past and the past participle But these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs For example the plain present of be is usually are but the plain form is be Also the past of eat is ate but the past participle is eaten When you look for a verb in the dictionary it is usually the plain form that you look for,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Participle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Many people still live by subsistence agriculture on a small farm They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer his family and his animals The yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land and it is often low This is because subsistence farmers are generally less education and they have less money to buy equipment Drought and other problems sometimes cause famines Where yields are low deforestation can provide new land to grow more food This provides more nutrition for the farmer s family but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Yield 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Education 0 0 0 0 Money 0 0 0 Drought 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Deforestation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nutrition 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Environment 0 0 0
In rich countries farms are often fewer and larger During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better variety  of plants use more fertilizer use more water and more easily control weeds and pests Many farms also use machines so fewer people can farm more land There are fewer farmers in rich countries but the farmers are able to grow more,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers pesticides and herbicides These chemicals can pollute the soil or the water They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals causing outbreaks of these pests The soil can be damaged by erosion salt buildup or loss of structure Irrigation can pollute water and lower the water table These problems have all got solutions and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pollute 0 Soil 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Erosion 0 0 0 0 0 0 Irrigation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Dinosaurs were a varied group of animals Adaptive radiation let them live in many ecological niches Palaeontology have identified over 500 different genera and 1 000 species of non avian dinosaurs Their descendants the birds number 9 000 living species and are the most diverse group of land vertebrates,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Adaptive_radiation 0 0 0 0 0 0 Palaeontology 0 0 0 0 0 Genera 0 0 0 Species 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The largest dinosaurs were herbivores such as Apatosaurus and Brachiosaurus They were the largest animals to ever walk on dry land Other plant eaters such as Iguanodon had special weapons to help them fight off the meat eaters For example Triceratops had three horns on its head shield Ankylosaurus was covered in boney plates and Stegosaurus had spikes on its tail,0 0 0 0 Herbivores 0 0 Apatosaurus 0 Brachiosaurus 0 0 0 0 Animals 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Iguanodon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Triceratops 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ankylosaurus 0 0 0 0 0 0 Stegosaurus 0 0 0 0 0
The carnivores were bipedal though not as we do Their body was more towards the horizontal balanced at the back by their tail Some were very large like Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus but some were small like Compsognathus It was the smaller sized meat eaters that may have evolution into birds The first fossil bird Archaeopteryx had a skeleton which looked much like that of a dinosaur,0 0 0 Bipedal 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Horizontal 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tail 0 0 0 0 0 Tyrannosaurus 0 Spinosaurus 0 0 0 0 0 Compsognathus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Evolution 0 0 0 0 Fossil 0 Archaeopteryx 0 0 Skeleton 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

It is now certain that small theropods had feathers This fits well with the idea that they were warm blooded and that the origin of birds can be traced to a line of small theropods,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Feathers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Warm blooded animals have a high metabolic rate They can be more active and for longer than animals who depend on the environment for heating Therefore the idea of warm blooded dinosaurs insulated by feathers led to the idea that they were more active intelligent and faster runners than previously thought,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Environment 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

As the Atlantic slowly gets wider the Pacific is slowly shrinking It does this by folding the sea floor in towards the center of the Earth this is called subduction This bumping and grinding is hard so there are many earthquakes and volcanoes when the builds up and is quickly released as large explosion of hot Rock  and dust When an earthquake happens under the sea the quick jerk causes a tsunami This is why tsunamis are more common around the edge of the Pacific than anywhere else Many of the Earth s volcanoes are either islands in the Pacific or are on continents within a few hundred kilometers of the ocean s edge Plate tectonics are another reason which makes Pacific Ocean smaller,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earth 0 0 0 Subduction 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earthquakes 0 Volcanoes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Explosion 0 0 0 0 Dust 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tsunami 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Islands 0 0 0 0 0 0 Continents 0 0 0 0 Kilometers 0 0 0 0 0 Plate_tectonics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Machine code is a computer program written in machine language It uses the instruction set of a particular computer architecture It is usually written in Binary number Machine code is the lowest level of software Other programming languages are translated into machine code so the computer can execute them,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Binary_number 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Software 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
An instruction tells the process what operation to perform Each instruction is made up of an opcode and operand The operands are usually memory addresses or data An instruction set is a list of the opcodes available for a computer Machine code is what Assembly language and other programming languages are compiled to or interpreted as,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Opcode 0 Operand 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Computer 0 0 0 0 Assembly_language 0 0 0 0 Compiled 0 0 0 0

Every processor or processor family has its own instruction set Instructions are patterns of bits that correspond to different commands that can be given to the machine Thus the instruction set is specific to a class of processors using the same architecture,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Systems may also differ in other details such as memory arrangement operating systems or peripheral devices Because a program normally relies on such factors different systems will typically not run the same machine code even when the same type of processor is used,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Most instructions have one or more opcode fields They specify the basic instruction type Other fields may give the type of the operands the addressing mode and so on There may also be special instructions that are contained in the opcode itself These instructions are called immediates,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A polypeptide is a single linear polymer chain of amino acids The sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide comes from the DNA sequence of a gene see Translation  and RNA splicing for a fuller account The genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids Shortly after synthesis some amino acids are chemically modified This alters the folding stability activity and function of the protein Sometimes proteins have non peptide groups attached as Cofactor s,0 0 0 0 0 0 Polymer 0 0 0 0 Sequence 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 DNA_sequence 0 0 Gene 0 0 0 RNA_splicing 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Proteins do different things depending on their shape They can be found in meat or muscle They are used for growth and repair as well as for strengthening the bones They help to make tissue and cells They are in animals plants fungi bacteria and also in the human body,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Meat 0 Muscle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Animals Plants 0 0 0 0 0 0 Human 0
Muscles contain a lot of protein When protein is digested it is broken down into amino acids These amino acids can then be used to build new protein Proteins form an important part in foods like milk Egg  meat fish beans and Nut  and pulses There are four things that determine what a protein will do The first is the order of the amino acids There are 20 different types of amino acids The second is the little twists in the chain The third is how the entire thing is folded up The fourth is whether it is made up of different sub units Haemoglobin molecules for example are made of four sub units,Muscles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Milk 0 Meat Fish Beans 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Haemoglobin 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Proteins are necessary in an animal s diets since animals cannot make all the amino acids they need They must get certain amino acids from food These are called the essential amino acids Through digestion animals break down ingested protein into free amino acids The amino acids are then used in metabolism to make the enzymes and structures the body needs,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Digestion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Metabolism 0 0 0 Enzymes 0 0 0 0 0

Since the time of Caesar many improved cyphers have been made Some involved clever mathematics to resist clever cryptanalysis During the 20th century computers became the principle tool of cryptography,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cryptanalysis 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In a symmetric key algorithm both the sender and receiver share the key The sender uses the key to hide the message Then the receiver will use the same key in the opposite way to reveal the message For centuries most cryptography has been symmetric Advanced Encryption Standard is a widely used one However this is not to be confused with symmetry,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Advanced_Encryption_Standard 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The details of asymmetric cryptography make it less useful than symmetric cryptography for actually sending messages Instead it is often used for computer signatures when a computer must know that a file was sent from a certain sender For example computer software companies that release updates for their software can sign those updates to prove that the update was made by them so that hackers cannot make their own updates that would cause harm Computers can also use asymmetric ciphers to give each other the keys for symmetric ciphers,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Computer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Software 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hackers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Computers can calculate quickly They can do very strong encryption and most 21st century cryptography uses them Examples are computer algorithms like RSA AES and there are many others Using good algorithms like these can make it very hard to read the information that is sent,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Algorithms 0 Rsa AES 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Tony Stark is usually shown as a This means that he has sex with a lot of women He is also very proud and often very selfish Sometimes he makes very bad decisions either because he does not think enough about what he is going to do or because he does not realize how his actions will affect others For example in the comics he does a lot of things that he regrets during the Civil War  Stark is also an alcoholic He is often drunk He did not have a good childhood and this affects how he acts,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sex 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Alcoholic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In physics it presents atoms as made of particle physics in preference to say the wave theory of light In fact both the particle and wave view are required to explain everything light does but are rarely presented as equals Many physics students graduate fully understanding the hydrogen bomb but having no clear idea of how musical instruments work,0 Physics 0 0 Atoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Greedy Reductionism may be more likely among believers in mechanistic ideas For instance they may want to always see things as made of smaller even invisible parts that no one can see or prove is real like in string theory,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 String_Theory

The philosophy of mathematics of most believers is a form of Platonism This assumes there is a perfect or ideal form that theories only approximate This lets them explain inaccuracies in mechanistic theories as being due to an imperfection in human ability to reason instead of imperfections in math itself,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Platonism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Believers in this paradigm sometimes say that those who do not believe in it are following a cognitive paradigm but almost no one uses this term since it is redundant cognitive science is already accepted as the most basic idea in the philosophy of science But mechanists reject some of the ideas of cognitive scientists like cognitive science of mathematics,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Redundant 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Mechanistic thinking also assumes that philosophy of perception is much less important than cognitive scientists say it is that humans and their beliefs and equipment do not generally add a lot of bias to a scientific theory Thomas Kuhn said otherwise that these things matter and that the major assumptions of science can shift drastically This he called a paradigm shift The shift from mechanistic to cognitive paradigm is an example of this,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bias 0 0 0 0 Thomas_Kuhn 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Technology is often easier to make if people accept a mechanistic paradigm but it may be harder to say why it does not work if one believes in these ideas For instance creating diagnostic trees might be easier if one works from experience not from an idea of how a technology should or must work,Technology 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Creating 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Experience 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Before 1600 people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold but no one managed to do that This was called alchemy Alchemists separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it They also processed special minerals from a mine in Sweden to get rare earth metals Radioactivity was also discovered Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements Some are very common like oxygen Many are very rare and expensive like platinum Some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs like rutherfordium,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sweden 0 0 0 Radioactivity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Oxygen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Platinum 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rutherfordium

There are several types of chemistry Analytical chemistry looks at which chemicals are in things For example looking at how much arsenic is in food Organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them For example making acetylene Inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them One example is making an integrated circuit,0 0 0 0 0 0 Analytical_chemistry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Arsenic 0 0 0 Organic_chemistry 0 0 0 0 0 Carbon 0 0 0 0 0 Acetylene Inorganic_chemistry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry This looks at plastics One example is making nylon Because plastics are made of carbon polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry Another area is biochemistry This looks at the chemistry of living things An example would be seeing how arsenic poisons people Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry There are many other small branches of chemistry,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nylon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Biochemistry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Arsenic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The basic unit of an Chemical element is called an atom An atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down A chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements In a compound two or more atoms are joined together to form a molecule The tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules Mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted An example would be mixing sand and salt This can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction An example would be heating sodium bicarbonate common baking soda It will make water carbon dioxide and sodium carbonate This reaction cannot be undone,0 0 0 0 0 Chemical_element 0 0 0 Atom 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Substance 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Molecule 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Liquid 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Carbon_Dioxide 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds too Copper chloride is an example CuCl 2 is its chemical formula There is one copper atom and two chlorine atoms That means in 134 45 grams of copper chloride there is one mole of copper chloride molecules This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants should be left If too much reactant is used there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Copper_chloride 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Shield volcanoes are built out of layers of lava from continual eruptions Because the lava is so fluid it spreads out often over a wide area Shield volcanoes do not grow to a great height and the layers of lava spread out to give the volcano gently Shield volcanoes can produce huge areas of basalt which is usually what lava is when cooled,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lava 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Basalt 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Unlike shield volcanoes stratovolcanoes have a steep profile and periodic eruptions The lava that flows from stratovolcanoes cools and hardens before spreading far It is sticky that is it has high viscosity The magma forming this lava is often felsic with high to intermediate levels of silica and less mafic magma Big felsic lava flows are uncommon but have travelled as far as,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Viscosity 0 Magma 0 0 Lava 0 0 Felsic 0 0 0 0 0 0 Silica 0 0 Mafic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The asteroid belt or main belt is a ring of small and large rocks and dust between the orbits of Mars  and Jupiter  The biggest object in the asteroid belt is Ceres  a dwarf planet The Kirkwood gaps separate the asteroid belt into several groups,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Orbits 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dwarf_Planet 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In general the formation and evolution of the Solar System happened when a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form the Sun and planetesimals and eventually the planets This gravitational accretion led to the formation of the rocky planets and the gas giants,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gravity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Planetesimals in the region which would become the asteroid belt were too strongly disturbed by Jupiter s gravity to form a planet Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before while occasionally colliding In regions where the velocity of the collisions was too high the shattering of planetesimals was more common than accretion preventing the formation of planet sized bodies,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

White blood cells find where the germs are and start to destroy them WBCs arrive in the blood They also go out of the blood in places where there is infection WBCs do this to fight the germs that make the infection If they go out of the blood to fight an infection they may return in the lymphatic system So WBCs are in lymph nodes,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infection 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The different WBCs work in different ways Some WBCs kill and eat germs and cancer cells Some WBCs make antibody that mark a cell so other WBCs will kill it Some WBCs make chemicals They release these chemicals to fight things that do not belong in the body These chemicals cause inflammation in a part of the body When a germ makes someone sick the body shows it If a bacteria gets under someone s skin and causes an infection the skin gets red hot and painful This redness heat and pain are signs of inflammation This shows that WBCs are fighting the infection and killing the bacteria,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Antibody 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Inflammation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bacteria 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infection 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Marxism says that people in the world are organized into different groups or Social class based on what they do for work,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Social_class 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

It is this Surplus Value or Profit which Marxism thinks as an exploitation of labor This exploitation allows the smaller class to live without working while the bigger class have to work for the capitalists to survive,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Marxists think that all of written human history has been divided by Social class One example is feudal society The ruling class got their power and wealth from the labor of peasants But as peasants demanded more and more for themselves small shopkeepers and tradespeople began to appear Many of these people formed guilds as well and eventually began to employ workers These workers were able to gain wealth for themselves at these jobs These historical events created capitalism,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Social_class 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In this way Marxists think that history has been pushed forward by class struggle They think that change will be born from this struggle just like capitalism was However they also think that capitalism will give way to communism as the workers struggle becomes more and more revolutionary,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Revolutionary
Marxism recognizes that in earlier time periods we lived first under rulers who owned everything Then we lived under lords who owned land with workers who lived and worked on that land In Marx s time people lived under governments that allowed many people to own property Eventually Marxists believe that we will move to a society where everyone owns everything in common This will be called socialism,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Property 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In other words human society has always been based on the economic forces that human beings can control,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Internet Explorer 4 released in September 1997 deepened the level of integration between the web browser and the underlying operating system Installing version 4 on a Windows 95 or Windows NT 4 machine and choosing Windows Desktop Update would result in the traditional Windows Explorer also being replaced by a version more akin to a web browser interface as well as the Windows desktop itself being web enabled via Active Desktop The integration with Windows however was subject to numerous packaging criticisms This option was no longer available with the installers for later versions of Internet Explorer but was not removed from the system if already installed Internet Explorer 4 introduced support for Group Policy allowing companies to configure and lock down many aspects of the browser s configuration as well as support for offline browsing Internet Mail and News was replaced with Outlook Express and Microsoft Chat and an improved NetMeeting were also included This version also was included with Windows 98 New features were added that allow you to save and retrieve posts in comment forms which are still not being used today Internet Explorer 4 5 offered new features such as easier 128 bit encryption It also offered a dramatic stability improvement over prior versions particularly the 68k version which was especially prone to freezing,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Outlook_Express 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Windows_98 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In Windows Vista Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called Protected Mode where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restricted it cannot make any system wide changes One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add ons As a result even if the browser or any add on is compromised the damage the security breach can cause is limited,0 Windows_Vista 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself but ActiveX based add ons used by it Because the add ons have the same privilege as IE the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws This has led to the ActiveX based architecture being criticized for being fault prone By 2005 some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX have been overstated and there were safeguards in place In 2006 new techniques using automated testing found more than a hundred vulnerabilities in standard Microsoft ActiveX components Security features introduced in then recently released Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ActiveX 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The ActiveX extension mechanism is used by many public websites and web applications including eBay Similarly Browser Helper Objects are also used by many Web search engine companies and third parties for creating add ons that access their services such as search engine toolbars Because of the use of COM it is possible to embed web browsing functionality in third party applications Hence there are a number of Internet Explorer shells and a number of content centric applications like RealPlayer also use Internet Explorer s web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications,0 ActiveX 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ebay 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Web_search_engine 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Christians consider the Holy Bible to be a sacred book inspired by God The Holy Bible is a combination of the Hebrew Bible or Torah and a collection of writings called the New Testament Views on the importance of these writings vary Some Christian groups prefer to favor the New Testament while others believe the entire Bible is equally important Also while many Christians prefer to consider the Bible as true inspired by God not all groups believe that it is completely accurate Some of these groups may think that the Bible is a collection of stories meant to show who God is or even just the opinions of humans that reveal some commonly believed truth,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Many Christians choose to go to church Most Christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to God and an act of worship However some Christian groups think that one can be a Christian without ever going to a church Though there are many different viewpoints on the issue most Protestants believe all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ whether or not those Christians go to an actual church each week On the other hand Catholics believe that the Holy Catholic Church is the only true church,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Catholics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

After the Nationalist government fled the Mainland in 1948 49 they brought their language Mandarin with them and made Mandarin the only official language Then everyone in the ROC had to learn Mandarin But unlike the people in Mainland China the Taiwanese never changed to simplified Chinese characters and so they have always used traditional Chinese characters In the past students were not allowed to speak their mother tongue in school and were expected to speak only Mandarin Taiwanese Hakka and native languages were considered bad until the early 1990s when education in these languages began to be taught in some school systems They were promoted but by this time many young people could speak only Mandarin,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mother_Tongue 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Apparently early humans did not possess salivary amylase The closest evolutionary relatives of humans chimpanzees and bonobos have either one or no copies of the gene for producing salivary amylase A duplication event of the AMY1 gene led to the production of amylase in the saliva The same event occurred independently in rodents This shows the importance of salivary amylase in organisms that eat relatively large amounts of starch,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chimpanzees 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rodents 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Not all humans have the same number of copies of the AMY1 gene Populations which rely on carbohydrates have a higher number of AMY1 copies than populations that eat little starch The number of AMY1 gene copies in humans can range from six copies in agricultural groups such as European American and Japanese to only 2 3 copies in hunter gatherer societies such as the Aka people Datog and Yakuts,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Agricultural 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The correlation between starch consumption and number of AMY1 copies suggests that more AMY1 copies in high starch populations is caused by natural selection It is a favorable phenotype for those individuals Therefore it is likely that having more copies of AMY1 in a high starch population increases fitness and produces healthier fitter offspring Geographically close populations with different eating habits possess a different number of copies of the AMY1 gene This offers strong evidence that natural selection has acted on this gene,0 Correlation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Phenotype 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fitness 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Homer is the name of the Ancient Greece poet who wrote the epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey These are the earliest works of Greek literature which have survived to the present day and are among the greatest treasures of the ancient world They are a product of Mycenaean culture The Iliad tells the story of the Trojan war which took place around 1190 BC The manuscripts of Homer were written much later probably later than 800 BC,0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancient_Greece 0 0 0 0 0 0 Iliad 0 0 Odyssey 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mycenaean_culture 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Trojan_War 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
What makes the history of this period so difficult is that the Mycenaean civilization was followed by several hundred years of decline from which little or no writing has survived This period the Greek Dark Age ended around 800 BC when once again we find Greek writing though this time in their newly developed alphabetic script Therefore there is a distinct possibility that the Homeric epics had a life perhaps a long life as oral literature spoken by story tellers,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The fibre gained from the banana plant has been used to make textiles for a long time In Japan bananas have been grown to be used for clothes and in the house since at least the 13th century In the Japanese system the leaves and shoots are cut from the plant periodically to make sure they are soft The harvested shoots must first be boiled in lye to prepare the fibres for the making of the yarn These banana shoots produce fibres of varying degrees of softness They can be used for yarns and textiles of different qualties and for specific uses For example the outermost fibres of the shoots are the coarsest they are good for tablecloths The softest innermost fibres are desirable for kimono and hakama This traditional Japanese banana cloth making process has many steps all performed by hand,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Textiles 0 0 0 0 0 Japan 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Clothes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 13th_century 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lye 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Yarn 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Kimono 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A photon has a given frequency which determines its color Radio technology makes great use of frequency Beyond the visible range frequency is less discussed for example it is little used in distinguishing between X Ray photons and infrared Frequency is equivalent to the quantum energy of the photon as related by the Planck constant equation,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infrared 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Planck_constant 0
Another important property of a photon is its polarity If you saw a giant photon coming straight at you it could appear as a swath whipping vertically horizontally or somewhere in between Polarized sunglasses stop photons swinging up and down from passing This is how they reduce glare as light bouncing off of surfaces tend to fly that way Liquid crystal displays also use polarity to control which light passes through Some animals can see light polarization,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Polarity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Polarization

Most of a dragonfly s life is spent in the nymph form beneath the water s surface It is quite active It can extend its jaws in front of its mouth to catch prey Tiny vertebrates such as tadpoles and fish are part of its diet Some nymphs even hunt on land They draw water in and out of their rectum They can move fast by squirting water out of the anus They also have gills in their rectum,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vertebrates 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Diet 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rectum 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Anus 0 0 0 Gills 0 0 0
The larval stage of large dragonflies may last as long as five years In smaller species this stage may last between two months and three years When the larva is ready to metamorphose into an adult it climbs up a Reed  or other emergent plant Exposure to air causes the larva to begin breathing The skin splits at a weak spot behind the head and the adult dragonfly crawls out of its old larval skin pumps up its wings and flies off to feed on midges and flies The adult stage of larger species of dragonfly can last as long as five or six months,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
While living in the water the naiads eat as many aquatic insects as possible as well as other small creatures like tadpoles and minnows Hidden among the plants a naiad will lie in wait for prey to swim by It can then squeeze water out of the rear of its abdomen like a jet stream This moves the naiad forward very quickly allowing it to snatch its prey with its powerful jaws Some naiads even have a long lower jaw that can shoot out and grab prey,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Abdomen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Naiads live in the water for weeks and undergo a series of moults to grow When a naiad is ready for its final moult it finds a stick or other object sticking out of the water It use this to crawl out of the water and wait for its exoskeleton to dry As the exoskeleton cracks open at the seam the adult dragonfly crawls out,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Exoskeleton 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Some time before 1565 an enormous deposit of graphite was discovered in Borrowdale Cumbria The locals found that it was very useful for marking sheep This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid and it could easily be sawn into sticks This is still the only large scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead Consequently it was called plumbago The black core of pencils is still referred to as lead even though it never contained the Chemical element lead,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Graphite 0 0 0 0 Cumbria 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chemistry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chemical_element Lead
The value of graphite was soon realized mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for cannonballs The mines were taken over by the government and guarded When sufficient stocks of graphite had been accumulated the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required Graphite had to be smuggled out for use in pencils Because graphite is soft it requires some form of holder Graphite sticks were at first wrapped in string or in Leather for stability The news of the usefulness of these early pencils spread far and wide attracting the attention of artists all over the known world,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Government 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Leather 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The aim of Cricket is to score more Runs than the other team Runs are gained by batsmen running between the wickets after a ball has been bowled hitting the ball over the boundary or by the umpires penalizing the bowling side for bowling an illegal ball,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The batsman is trying to defend the wicket from getting hit with the ball He does this with a bat When he hits the ball with his bat he may run toward the other wicket To score a run the two batsmen must both run from their wicket to the other wicket as many times as they can before they can be run out Being run out is explained below If the ball leaves the field after being hit without bouncing six runs are scored If the ball rolls or bounces out whether or not the batter hit it it counts as four runs,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When a batsman is out another comes onto the field to take his place The innings is over when ten wickets are taken After this the team which was the fielding team becomes the batting team They now have to score more runs than the other team managed to score If they score more runs before ten wickets are taken they win If they do not the other team wins,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Netnews is a kind of online service that shares articles between a group of computers over a network One kind of netnews is called usenet Usenet was started in 1980 before the Internet and is still very active today Usenet provided a way for people to write articles on many different topics and share them with people all over the world Articles are sent to all the computers in the community This differers from an message on a webserver which stays on one computer until a person gets it with their web browser,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Internet 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Articles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Community 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Webserver 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The community of computers comprising a Usenet typically does not include those of end users e g home personal computers Rather that community consists of a group of cooperating servers End users must have access to a member of the server community to read and post Such access is typically achieved through the news feature of their email computer program or web browser or through a special program that specializes in netnews Configuring the program requires the URL of a server and often a user ID and password,0 0 0 Computers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Servers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Email 0 0 Web_Browser 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Url 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Password
The servers in the Usenet community are independent in the sense that each gets to decide what portions of the Usenet they will serve to their users and how long postings will last on the server For example some servers may leave out the adult groups Because postings have to be transmitted from computer to computer a given posting takes some time to be available on all servers Further they may disappear from active groups on busy servers in a matter of days or weeks,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Because Usenet groups are frequently used to share large files servers may have bandwidth and download limits If you use a commercial service it may offer a range of limits at different prices,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bandwidth 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A netnews service may not even be a community of computers Any user could configure their personal computer to offer a netnews service Organizations often offer their own netnews service independent of Usenet to support their customers and members For example news microsoft com is a very large community of Microsoft users and developers that help each other out,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Microsoft 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Because ice floats even large bodies of water that freeze like some oceans only form ice on the surface Most lakes never freeze to the bottom Even the coldest oceans like the Arctic Ocean only freeze on the top leaving liquid ocean circulating below Because of this the Earth s oceans are able to redistribute heat and the climate of the earth has less extremes of heat and cold than it would otherwise If ice were to sink instead of float the oceans would fill up with ice from the bottom would remain solid and only some of the top would thaw A solid ocean would not circulate heat But because ice floats on the surface the water beneath can continue to circulate and the ice on the surface stays exposed and readily melts when the temperature rises Antarctica has the majority of the world s ice,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Oceans 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Arctic_Ocean 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Climate 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Surface 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Antarctica 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A Coast Guard is an organization that protects people at sea The role of a coastguard varies greatly by country The coast guard is sometimes part of a military or a semi military organization or else is a law enforcement agency However the coast guard is always separate from the Navy,0 0 0 0 0 Organization 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Military 0 0 0 Military 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Navy
For example the United States Coast Guard is a branch of the military Their duties include searching for people ships and boats in danger at sea rescuing those in danger and law enforcement to protect people from terrorism and crimes at sea It can also become part of the Navy in a time of war,0 0 0 United_States_Coast_Guard 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ships 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Terrorism 0 Crimes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In golf a golfer plays a number of holes in a given order 18 holes played in an order controlled by the golf course design normally make up a game On a nine hole course two nine hole rounds make up a normal game,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Each hole starts from the teeing area Golfers put the ball on a small stand called a tee and swing a club at it to try and hit it as straight and far as possible Once each golfer in the group has done this the person whose ball landed farthest from the hole hits his again followed by everyone else one person at a time until everyone is on the green The green is the area near the hole where the grass is cut very short,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A famous example of science in action was the expedition led by Arthur Eddington to Principe Island in Africa in 1919 He went there to record the positions of stars around the Sun during a solar eclipse The observation of star positions showed that the apparent star positions close to the Sun were changed In effect the light passing the Sun was pulled towards the Sun by gravitation This confirmed predictions of gravitational lensing made by Albert Einstein in the general theory of relativity published in 1915 Eddington s observations were considered to be the first solid evidence in favour of Einstein s theory Had the observations resulted differently this would have counted against Einstein s theory and perhaps refuted it,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Expedition 0 0 Arthur_Eddington 0 Principe_Island 0 Africa 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gravitation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Albert_Einstein 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Not everyone completely agrees about how science works Some philosophers and scientists say that scientific theories are only accepted for the time being They last so long as they are the best explanation When theories no longer explain the data they are discarded and replaced Or sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than discard it or they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Philosophers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Cancer is a type of disease where cells grow out of control divide and invade other tissues In a person without cancer cell division is under control In most tissues healthy cells divide in a controlled way and copy themselves to create new healthy cells With cancer this normal process of cell division goes out of control Cells change their nature because mutations have occurred in their genes All the daughter cells of cancer cells are also cancerous,0 0 0 0 0 Disease 0 Cells 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tissues 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tissues 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mutations 0 0 0 0 Genes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The symptoms of cancer are caused by the cancerous cells invading other tissues This is called metastasis Metastasis is a process in which cancer cells move through the bloodstream or lymphatic system When this happens a person s cancer can be spread throughout his or her body Eventually those other tissues cannot work as well and the whole body begins to get worse and may die,0 Symptoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Metastasis 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bloodstream 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The body s immune system usually will not attack cancer cells even though they could easily kill the body This is because the cancer has actually become a part of the body by invading cells and tissues So the immune system sees the cancer as part of the body it is trying to protect not as a threat to be attacked,0 0 0 Immune_System 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Many many people in many countries study cancer and work on finding treatments There has been some good progress in finding treatments and many cancers are treated with success Along with looking for different medical treatments to treat cancer some studies also look for things that people with cancer can do themselves to try to make themselves healthier For example one study showed that if a person with lymphedema lifts weights he may be able to fight his cancer better than somebody who does not lift weights,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Another very early type of surgery used to treat cancer was written about in the 1020s In The Canon of Medicine Avicenna said that treatment should involve cutting out all diseased tissue This included the use of amputation or removing veins that ran in the direction of the tumor Avicenna also suggested that the area that had been treated should be cauterized if needed Patricia Skinner Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Avicenna 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Amputation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A British surgeon named Percivall Pott was the first person to figure out one of the real causes of cancer In 1775 he discovered that cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps Other doctors started studying this topic and coming up with other ideas about what causes cancer Doctors then started working together and coming up with better ideas,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Scrotum 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the 18th century many people started to use the microscope and this made a big difference in helping doctors and scientists understand more about cancer Using the microscope scientists were able to see that the cancer poison spread from one tumor through the lymphatic system to other sites This was first made clear by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between 1871 and 1874,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Microscope 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Before the 19th century using surgery to treat cancer usually had bad results Doctors did not understand how important hygiene is for preventing disease especially after surgery Because things were not kept clean during or after surgery patients often got Infectious disease and died For example one well known Scottish surgeon Alexander Monro kept records and found that 58 patients out of every 60 who had surgery for breast tumors died within the next two years,0 0 0 0 0 Surgery 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hygiene 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infectious_disease 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the 19th century surgical hygiene got better because of asepsis Doctors realized that dirtiness and Pathogen cause infections so they started to keep things cleaner and do things to kill germs in order to prevent their patients from getting infections It became more common for people to survive after having surgery Surgical removal of the tumor became the first choice treatment for cancer For this kind of treatment to work the surgeon doing the operation had to be very good at removing tumors,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Asepsis 0 0 0 0 0 Pathogen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In the 1890s French scientists discovered radioactive decay Radiation therapy became the first cancer treatment that worked and did not involve surgery It required a new multi disciplinary approach to cancer treatment The surgeon was no longer working by himself he worked together with hospital Radiology to help patients This team approach meant changes in how they worked The different people on the team had to communicate with each other and work together which they were not used to doing It also meant that treatment had to be done in a hospital rather than at the patient s home Because of this patients information had to be put together into files kept at the hospital Because this information was now being kept and written down scientists were able to do the first statistics patient studies using numbers to study questions like how many people who have a certain type of cancer or get a certain treatment survive,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Radiation_therapy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Radiology 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Statistics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Before World War II doctors and hospitals were getting better at collecting data about their patients who had cancer but it was rare for this data to be shared with other doctors or hospitals This changed after WWII when medical research centers found out that different countries had very different number of cases of cancer Because of this many countries created national public health organizations These national public health organizations began to bring together health data from many different doctors and hospitals This helped them figure out some of the reasons why cancer was so much more common in certain places For example in Japan people studying cancer found out that people who had survived the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had bone marrow that was completely destroyed This helped them realize that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation which was a very important step in figuring out that leukemia can be treated with bone marrow transplants,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Leukemia 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Since World War II scientists have kept finding better cancer treatments However there are some things that still need to get better For example while there are good treatments for many kinds of cancer there are still no treatments for certain kinds of cancer or for some cancers once they progress to a certain stage of the disease Also the cancer treatments that do exist are not all standardized Cancer treatments are also not available everywhere in the world People need to keep studying cancer epidemiology and forming international partnerships to find cures and make cancer treatments available everywhere,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

While mathematicians all accept zero as a number some non mathematicians would say that zero is not a number arguing that one cannot have zero of something Others say that if one has a bank balance of zero one has a specific quantity of money in that account namely none It is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Normally speaking there was no year zero between 1 BC and 1 AD More exactly almost all historians leave out the year zero from the proleptic Gregorian calendar and proleptic Julian calendar but astronomers include it in these same calendars However the phrase Year Zero  may be used to describe any event considered so important that someone might want to start counting years all over again from zero,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Historians 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Astronomers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The modern numeral 0 is normally written as a circle or rectangle In old style fonts with text figures 0 is usually the same height as a lowercase x,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
On the seven segment displays of calculators watches etc 0 is usually written with six line segments though on some historical calculator models it was written with four line segments The four segment 0 is not common,0 0 Seven 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The number zero is not the same as the numeral or digit zero used in numeral systems using positional notation Successive positions of digits have higher values so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits A zero digit is not always necessary in a different positional number system Something called bijective numeration is a possible example of a system without zeroes,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 is also used as a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals It is used to hold the place of that digit because correct placing of digits affects a numeral s value,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the numeral 10 which stands for one times ten and zero units,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the numeral 100 which stands for one times a hundred plus zero tens plus zero units,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In paper writing you do not have to make the 0 and O look different at all Or you may add a slash across the zero in order to show the difference although this sometimes causes mistakes in the number 0,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

When layers are made the bumps appear Many bumps form one continuous spiral that can include information After that a spray of a special reflective layer covers the bumps,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Aluminum is applied behind inner layers and semi reflective gold covers the outer layers This helps the laser to concentrate through the outer layers onto the inner ones Then after applying a protective liquid and pressing the layers they are treated with infrared light,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infrared 0
Every track on a DVD disk circles from its center to the edge The distance between the tracks on a DVD disk is 740 nanometers Only a very precise mechanism can read the bumps on the disk because they are very small,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The aluminum side of the disk has pits but the side which is read by the laser has bumps Because the size of the bumps are very small a DVD track is very long A data track of a DVD layer is about 7 5 miles long This is the length of an ordinary DVD disk The track of a disc with two sides would be about 30 miles long,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Miles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements including the conservation movement wellness movement environmental movement and ecology movement we know today When these are combined with peace movements and the Six Principles they are called green movements In general these put ecosystem health first on a list of human moral and political priorities as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony and better economics,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Peace 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Green 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Economics

Cartier sailed to what is now Canada in 1534 His men took the sons of a Wendat chief Donnacona with him to France on his first trip On his second trip he brought them back but later captured chief Donnacona and took him to France where Donnacona died Cartier raised a cross on the Gaspe Peninsula in front of the First Nations This cross showed that the lands belonged to France,0 0 0 0 0 0 Canada 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The idea of bartering things is very old A long time ago people did not buy or sell with money Instead they traded one thing for another to get what they wanted or needed One person who owned many cows could trade with another person who had a lot of wheat Each would trade a little of what he had with the other This would support the people on his farm Other things that were easier to carry around than cows also came to be held as valuable This gave rise to trade items such as jewelry and spices,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Wheat 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Jewelry 0 Spices
When people changed from trading in things like for example cows and wheat to using money instead they needed things that would last a long time They must still have a known value and could be carried around The first country in the world to make metal coins was called Lydia These first appeared during the 7th century BC in the western part of what is now Turkey The Lydian coins were made of a weighed amount of precious metal and were stamped with a picture of a lion This idea soon spread to Greece the rest of the Mediterranean and the rest of the world Coins were all made to the same size and shape In some parts of the world different things have been used as money like clam shells or blocks of salt,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Coins 0 0 Lydia 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Turkey 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lion 0 0 0 0 0 Greece 0 0 0 0 Mediterranean 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Cows die and wheat rots But money lasts longer than most trade goods If someone sells a cow for money he can save that money away until he needs it He can always leave it to his children when he dies It can last a very long time and he can use it at any time,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Not every cow is as good as another cow Some cows are sick and old and others are healthy and young Some wheat is good and other wheat is moldy or stale So if a person trades cows for wheat he might have a hard time arguing over how much wheat each cow is worth However money is standard That means one dollar is worth the same as another dollar It is easier to add up and count money than to add up the value of different cows or amounts of wheat,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Commodity money can be used for other purposes besides serving as a medium of exchange We say it possesses intrinsic value because it is useful or valuable by itself Some examples of commodity money are cattle silk gold and silver Convertible paper money is money that is convertible into gold and silver Gold and Silver certificates are convertible paper money as they can be fully convertible into gold and silver,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cattle Silk Gold 0 Silver 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

When air cools the water in it condenses around dust or other particles in the air called condensation nuclei These small droplets then become visible as clouds As more and more droplets join together they become too heavy and fall from the cloud as rain,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

When the Sun heats the Earth s surface the ground heats the air above it Convection makes the air rise and cool When it cools to the dew point clouds form and rain follows This usually occurs on flat land This type of rainfall often causes summer showers and thunderstorms,0 0 Sun 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Convection 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dew_Point 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Relief rain usually occurs along coastal areas where a line of hills runs along the coast When wet onshore wind from the sea meets a mountain hill or any other sort of barrier it is forced to rise along the slope and cools When the air temperature falls to its dew point water vapour condenses to form clouds When the clouds can no longer hold the water droplets relief rain begins to fall on the windward slope of the mountain On the leeward slope air sinks it is warmed and further dried by compression Therefore the leeward slope is known as rain shadow Moist winds blow in from the sea and are forced to rise over the land The air cools and the water vapour condenses forming rain drops The rainiest places in the world are places that have relief rainfall,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hills 0 0 0 Coast 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mountain Hill 0 0 0 0 0 Barrier 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Slope 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Compression 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Frontal rain happens when cooler air and warmer humid air meet in a weather front The less dense warm air rises and condenses forming clouds These clouds grow and eventually create rain In some places on the northern temperate zone the cold air front tends to come from the north west and the warm air front comes from the south west,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Photographic film is a sheet of plastic used to record pictures The plastic has been specially treated so it is sensitive to light That way it is possible to record an invisible image with the plastic when it is exposed to light Normal film is shipped in small canisters that protect it from the light A normal photographic film can hold up to 40 pictures,0 0 0 0 0 0 Plastic 0 0 0 Pictures 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sensitive 0 Light 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Film needs the right amount of light to make a picture If the picture is too bright or too dark it will not record correctly The longer that the film keeps recording the more light it will get If what is being photographed is bright it will be recorded faster If it is darker the film will need more time to record,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Record 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Contract bridge or simply bridge is a trick taking card game which is played by two pairs of players one pair against the other pair page 1 Partners sit opposite each other at a table In face to face games a convenient table size is from 32 to 40 inches square In online computer play players from anywhere in the world sit at a virtual table,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The scoring system for bridge is very much more complicated than it is for whist Fundamentally it depends on whether or not declarer makes his contract or not If he does not the defending side collect penalty points If he does make the contract his side wins points How many points are won or lost depends on the scoring table,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In competitions and in some clubs boards are pre dealt by electro mechanical dealing machines The instructions to the machine are input by computer software This is used to generate the random distributions of cards in the four hands The cards are delivered straight into the boards used by the players This has many advantages over hand dealing First there is on the computer a record of all the hands which can be made available to players after the competition Second the deals are a better fit to ideal random hands than is possible with dealing by hand Thirdly the system makes it easy to run multi venue competitions which previously required a great deal of work,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Random 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In 1817 a German professor baron Karl von Drais created the first two wheeled bicycle It was made of wood and had two wheels The front wheel could be turned using the handlebars in order to steer the bike However it did not have pedals so the rider would have to push their feet on the ground to make it move,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the 1860s French inventors added pedals to the front wheel However it took a lot of effort to turn the pedals Later inventors made bikes out of metal only and made the front wheel very big giving higher speed This design was called the penny farthing bicycle However it was difficult to ride since it could fall easily and the rider would fall far,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Several improvements were made in the 1880s and 90s In 1885 the safety bicycle was invented This had two wheels the same size so that the rider could sit at a lower height It was called the safety bicycle because it much easier to ride than the penny farthing When stopping the rider can simply put down a foot instead of completely dismounting Instead of pedaling and steering with the front wheel the safety bicycle steers with the front wheel while the pedals turn the back wheel using a chain Brakes operated by hand levers on some bikes also increased safety,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Brakes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In 1888 Scottish inventor John Boyd Dunlop re invented a type of tire which was filled with air and this made cycling far more comfortable Soon the freewheel was invented This was a device inside the hub of the back wheel that allowed the wheel to spin even if the rider wasn t pedalling However this meant the rider could no longer stop the bike by backpedalling As a result a different type of brake was invented which could stop the bike if the pedals were turned backwards Later inventions included better brakes and gears which made cycling over hills much easier During this time the bicycle became very popular,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tire 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Brake 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Basic components common to most bikes include a seat pedals gearing handlebar wheels and brakes all mounted on a frame The majority also have a gear shifter The cyclist s feet push the pedals to make them go around in circles which moves the chain which turns the back wheel of the bike to make the bike move forwards The front wheel is connected to the handlebar so turning the handlebar from side to side swivels the front wheel which steers the bike,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gear 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Hume is famous for his Induction Fallacy This draws attention to a common mistake people make People see something and make claims that what they see will always be as they see it For example people see only white swans and claim that all swans are white This is fallacious or mistaken because it is always possible that they then will see a black swan,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Hume was also skeptical about religion He was not a religious person and religious people did not like his opinions He did not believe in miracles He said that suicide wasn t always wrong but never said whether or not he believed in God In 1776 when he was dying his friends found him very calm about death despite him not believing in an Afterlife Today Hume s books are very important to philosophers who are interested in religion,0 0 0 0 0 Religion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Suicide 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 God 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Death 0 0 0 0 0 0 Afterlife 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

After Mazarin died in 1661 Louis declared that he would rule France without a chief minister something no French king had done in living memory He intended to rule as an absolute monarch believing that his power as king was derived from God and that he was responsible to God alone He was obliged to rule for the benefit of his people While Louis assumed responsibility for decision making he understood that he must rule within the constraints of the laws and customs of his kingdom Louis consulted widely with his nobles and ministers and he met weekly with members of his high council He created an informal cabinet which was eventually led by Jean Baptiste Colbert chief minister of finance,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nobles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Starting in 1661 King Louis XIV transformed a humble hunting lodge into a glittering palace Over 30 000 men worked on constructing the Palace of Versailles a project that drained the royal treasury for decades Expenses included not only building but also diverting rivers piping in fresh water and planting thousands of orange trees to mask the smell of sewage that could not be properly drained away In May 1682 Louis moved the capital of France to Versailles 12 miles away of Paris It was Louis XIV s motive to remove himself and his nobles from the political intrigues of Paris It became a symbol of his Absolute Monarchy,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Versailles 0 0 0 0 Paris 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Louis revoked or ended the Treaty of Nantes This Treaty said that there would be freedom of religion in France This means that everybody in France could worship the way they wanted to When Louis revoked the Treaty of Nantes he said that all people in France must be Catholic Because of this 50 thousand Protestant workers left France and went to Americas England and Germany,0 0 0 0 0 Treaty_of_Nantes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Catholic 0 0 0 0 0 Protestant 0 0 0 0 0 0 Americas England 0 Germany
While Louis ruled France became the most powerful country in all of Europe and many other countries copied the French people s way of dressing and thinking He also encouraged people to explore Canada and tried very hard to make France larger Louis spent a lot of money on wars and France went into deep debt because of him,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Every color of light has a different wavelength The shorter the wavelength the more energy the light has The speed at which light moves does not depend on its energy Going through partly clear objects can slow light down by a very small amount,0 Color 0 0 0 0 0 Wavelength 0 0 0 0 0 0 Energy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
White light is made up of many different colors of light added together When white light shines through a prism it splits up into different colors becoming a spectrum The spectrum contains all of the wavelengths of light that we can see Red light has the longest wavelength and violet light has the shortest,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Prism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Spectrum 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Red 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Light with a wavelength shorter than violet is called ultraviolet light X rays and Gamma rays are also forms of light with even shorter wavelengths than ultraviolet Light with a wavelength longer than red is called infrared light Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength even longer than infrared light The microwaves that are used to heat food in a microwave oven are also a form of electromagnetic radiation Our eyes cannot see those kinds of energy but there are some cameras that can see them The various forms of light both visible and invisible are the electromagnetic spectrum,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ultraviolet 0 X Rays 0 Gamma_rays 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ultraviolet 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Infrared 0 Radio_waves 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Microwaves 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cameras 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Light and color are forms of analog information However electronic cameras and computer displays work with digital information So electronic cameras or document scanners make a digital version of a color image by separating out the full color image into separate red green and blue images Later a digital display uses pixels of just those three colors Computer computer monitor use only these three colors in different levels The brain combines them to see all of the other colors in the image,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Red Green 0 Blue 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Computer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Brain 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
People think of objects as having color Scientist explain this because the molecules that make up the object absorb certain light waves leaving the other light waves to bounce off The human eye sees the wavelengths of all of the light that was not absorbed and the combination of those leaves the brain with the impression of a color,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Molecules 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Inuit were also Nomadic people but they did not domesticate any animals except for dogs which they used to pull their sleds and help with the hunting They were hunter gatherer s living off the land They were very careful to make good use of every part of the animals they killed Respect for the land and the animals they harvested was and is a focal part of their culture,0 0 0 Nomadic_people 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hunter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Inuit lived in tents made of animal skins during the summer In the winter they lived in sod houses and igloos They could build an igloo out of snow bricks in just a couple of hours Snow is full of air spaces which helps it hold in warmth With just a blubber lamp for heat an igloo could be warmer than the air outside The Inuit made very clever things from the bones antlers and wood they had They invented the which was used to hunt seals and whales They built boats from wood or bone covered with animal skins They invented the kayak for one man to use for hunting the ocean and among the pack ice,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Houses 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Snow 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Whales 0 0 0 0 Wood 0 Bone 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Kayak 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ice

Inuit had to be good hunters to survive When an animal was killed in a hunt it was thanked respectfully for offering itself to the hunter They believed it intended to provide itself as a gift towards the survival of the hunter and his children Their gratitude was deeply sincere and is an important aspect of their belief system In the winter Pinniped did not come out onto the ice They only came up for air at holes they chewed in the ice Inuit would use their dogs to find the air holes then wait patiently until the seal came back to breathe and kill it with a In the summer the seals would lie out on the ice enjoying the sun The hunter would have to slowly creep up on a seal to kill it The Inuit would use their dogs and spears to hunt polar bears ox and caribou Sometimes they would kill caribou from their boats as the animals crossed the rivers on their migration,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pinniped 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Air 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Summer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sun 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ox 0 Caribou 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The Inuit even hunted whales From their boat they would throw harpoons that were attached to floats made of seal skins The whale would grow tired from dragging the floats under the water When it slowed down and came up to the surface the Inuit could keep hitting it with more harpoons or spears until it died Whale blubber provide Vitamin D and Omegas to their cultural diet and prevented rickets The whaling industry around the world has depleted the whale population and now traditional whale hunting for subsistence purposes is rare around the world Inuits have added to their modern northern diet with grocery foods which are normally very expensive in the north,0 0 0 0 Whales 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vitamin_D 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Whaling 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
During the summer months the Inuit were able to gather berries and roots to eat They also collected grass to line their boots or make baskets Often the food they found or killed during the summer was put into a cache for use during the long winter A cache was created by digging down to the permafrost and building a rock lined pit there The top would be covered with a pile of rocks to keep out the animals It was as good as a freezer because the food would stay frozen there until the family needed it Inuit cultural traditions and traditional stories provided each new generation with the lifeskills and knowledge to survive their environment and work together They usually moved around in small groups looking for food and sometimes they would get together with other groups to hunt for larger animals such as whales The men did the hunting and home building and also made weapons sleds and boats The women cooked made the clothes and took care of the children Children and infants under the ages of 5 became easy victims of hypothermia and if they were to die their mothers would weight the children s corpses with stones and wrap them in fishnets before placing the bodies through holes in the ice The mothers believed the children s souls were being offered to the god Phallus who would reincarnate them as whales,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Freezer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Whales 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Weapons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Clothes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Phallus 0 0 0 0 0 0
Today most Inuit live in modern houses Many still hunt or fish for a major part of their food supply and sometimes some income Seal pelts are used to protect from the extreme cold in the Arctic and are far more effective than man made fabrics The technology was worked well for many thousands of years Besides commercial winterwear is expensive They use gun and snowmobile s when hunting now however traditional values respecting the animals hunted still very much applies In Alaska many of the people have received money from the oil discovered in that state on their traditional lands,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gun 0 Snowmobile 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Alaska 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Oil 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The Arctic is very different from the rest of the world that the way of life in the south does not work well in the north Canada values having Inuit peoples in Canada s northernmost lands as proof of sovereignty over the Canadian portion of the Arctic Circle It s a very challenging living in an Arctic environment There is some controversy over the practice of sinking the corpses of child victims of hypothermia under the ice as bodies have been known to drift through the currents and wash up on the eastern coast of Canada and upon occasion the northeastern United States,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Northeastern_United_States

The number of people who live in a place does not tell us if it is a town or a village In many areas of the world like India a big village can have many more people than a small town It is also difficult to say if a place is a town because today some towns are becoming bigger,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 India 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In the six New England states a town is a smaller part of the county In all six towns do things that in most other states the counties do In many of these towns Town meeting are the main form of government so citizens can say what happens where they live by direct democracy In these states the towns are really more important than the county In Connecticut and Rhode Island counties are only on the map and have no power In the other four states counties are mostly places with law powers The counties with other functions are mostly in New Hampshire and Vermont,0 0 0 New_England 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 County 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Democracy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Connecticut 0 Rhode_Island 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 New_Hampshire 0 Vermont
In New York a town is also a smaller part of the county but it is less important than in New England In New York a town gives people more direct power than its county giving almost all town services to places not in towns called hamlets and some services to places in towns called villages In New York a town usually has some hamlets and villages But because villages have power without towns they can be in two towns or even two counties Everyone in New York State who does not live in an Indian reservation or a city lives in a town and perhaps in one of the town s hamlets or villages,0 New_York 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The Apocrypha are religious texts that are in some versions of the Catholic Bible Other versions omit them The word comes from Ancient Greek language Apocrypha means those that were hidden Generally the term is applied to writings that were not part of the canon There are several reasons why these texts were not included in the canon The texts might only have been known to few people or they might have been left out because their content does not fit well into that of the other books of the Bible Some of the apocrypha were written at a later date and were therefore not included,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancient_Greek_Language 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Canon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Stars are hot because nuclear reactions happen inside them Those reactions are called nuclear fusion Nuclear fusion makes light and heat and makes bigger and bigger chemical elements Stars have a lot of hydrogen Nuclear fusion changes hydrogen into helium When a star gets old it starts to change the helium into other bigger chemical elements like carbon and oxygen Fusion makes a lot of energy The energy makes the star very hot The energy produced by stars moves away from them Much of the energy leaves as light The rest leaves as other kinds of electromagnetic radiation,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hydrogen 0 0 0 Hydrogen 0 Helium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Helium 0 0 0 0 0 0 Carbon 0 Oxygen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Some stars look brighter than other stars This difference is measured in terms of apparent magnitude There are two reasons why stars have different apparent magnitude If a star is very close to us it will appear much brighter This is just like a candle A candle that is close to us appears brighter The other reason a star can appear brighter is that it is hotter than another cooler star,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Stars are made of mass and mass makes gravity Gravity makes planets orbit stars This is why the Earth orbits the Sun The gravity of two stars can make them go around each other Stars that orbit each other are called binary stars Scientists think there are many binary stars There are even groups of three or more stars that orbit each other Proxima Centauri is a small star that orbits other stars,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gravity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Astronomers organized stars into groups called constellations They used the constellations to help them see the motion of the planets and to guess the position of the Sun The motion of the Sun and the stars was used to make calendars The calendars were used by farmers to decide when to plant crops and when to harvest them,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Planets 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The smallest stars fuse their hydrogen slowly and live for 100 billion years Red dwarfs live longer than any other type of star At the end of their lives they become and dimmer Red dwarfs do not explode,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When very heavy stars die they explode This explosion is called a supernova When a supernova happens in a nebula the explosion pushes the gas in the nebula together This makes the gas in the nebula very thick Gravity and exploding stars both help to bring the gas together to make new stars in nebulas,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Supernova 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Most stars use up the hydrogen at their core When they do their core becomes smaller and becomes hotter It becomes so hot it pushes away the outer part of the star The outer part expands and it makes a red giant star Astro physicists think that in about 5 billion years the Sun will be a red giant Our Sun will be so large it will eat the Earth After our Sun stops using hydrogen to make energy it will use helium in its very hot core It will be hotter than when it was fusing hydrogen Heavy stars will also make elements heavier than helium As a star makes heavier and heavier elements it makes less and less energy Iron is a heavy element made in heavy stars,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Iron 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Our star is an average star Average stars will push away their outer gases The gas it pushes away makes a cloud called a planetary nebula The core part of the star will remain It will be a ball as big as the Earth and called a white dwarf It will fade into a black dwarf over a very long time,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The heaviest elements are made in the explosion of a supernova After billions of years of floating in space the gas and dust come together to make new stars and new planets Much of the gas and dust in space comes from supernovae Our Sun the Earth and all living things are made from star dust,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Astronomers have known for centuries that stars have different colors When looking at an electromagnetic spectrum ultraviolet waves are the shortest and infrared are the longest The visible spectrum has wavelengths between these two extremes,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Wavelengths 0 0 0 0
Modern instruments can measure very precisely the color of a star This allows astronomers to determine that star s temperature because a hotter star s black body radiation has shorter wavelengths The hottest stars are blue and violet then white then yellow and the coolest are red Knowing the color and absolute magnitude astronomers can place the star on the Hertzsprung Russell diagram and estimate its habitable zone and other facts about it,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Black 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
For example our Sun is white and the Earth is the perfect distance away for life If our Sun was a hotter blue star however Earth would have to be much farther away or else it would be too hot to have water and sustain life,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Some chemicals can help an enzyme do its job even better These are called activators Sometimes a chemical can slow down an enzyme or even make the enzyme not work at all These are called inhibitors Most drugs are chemicals that either speed up or slow down some enzyme in the human body,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In 1958 Daniel E  Koshland  Jr  suggested a modification to the lock and key model Since enzymes are rather flexible structures the active site is reshaped by interactions with the substrate As a result the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site The amino acid Side chain of the active site are bent into positions so the enzyme does its catalytic work In some cases such as glycosidases the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Side_chain 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Molecule 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Product stewardship includes waste disposal measures in the distribution of an industrial Product  That is paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product and relying on those who sold it to you to dispose of it,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Distribution 0 0 Industrial 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The slightly more specific idea of product take back means that the service of waste disposal is paid for at time of It is often applied to paint tires and other goods that become toxic waste if not disposed of properly It is most familiar as the deposit bottle where one pays for the loan of the bottle at the same time as one purchases what is inside it The container deposit charged for a deposit bottle may be a fee to buy the bottle separately from the fee to buy what it contains If one returns the bottle the fee is returned and the supplier must return the bottle for re use or recycling If not one has paid the fee and presumably this can pay for landfill or litter control measures that dispose of say a broken bottle Also since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving This is quite common for instance among homeless people,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Paint Tires 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Loan 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fee 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Re 0 0 Recycling 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Landfill 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Homeless 0
This principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires When purchasing paint or tires in many places one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become In some countries such as Germany law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction production distribution use and waste of a product and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally In the United States there have been many class action suits that are effectively product stewardship liability holding companies responsible for things the product does which it was never advertised to do,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Paint 0 Automobile 0 0 0 Tires 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Germany Law 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Uk 0 Eu 0 0 0 United_States 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Rather than let liability for these problems be taken up by the public sector or be haphazardly assigned one issue at a time to companies via lawsuits many accounting reform efforts focus on achieving full cost accounting This is the financial capital reflection of the comprehensive outcome noting the gains and losses to all parties involved not just those investing or purchasing Such moves have made moral purchasing more attractive as it avoids liability and future lawsuits,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Issue 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Financial_Capital 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

As Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out people may be hesitant to speak freely not because of fear of government punishment but because of social pressures When an individual announces an unpopular opinion he or she may face the disdain of their community or even be subjected to violent reactions While this type of suppression of speech is even more difficult to prevent than government suppression is there are questions about whether it truly falls within the ambit of freedom of speech which is typically regarded as a legal right to be exercised against the government or immunity from governmental action,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Punishment 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The early pianos had strings that were fastened to a frame made of wood They were not very heavy but they were not very strong or loud so they could not be heard very well in a big concert hall In 1825 the cast iron frame was invented in United States This made the piano much stronger so that it could make a bigger sound and the strings were not likely to break,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 United_States 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A piano has a Keyboard instrument with white keys and black keys When a key is pressed down the damper comes off the string and a hammer hits the string It hits it very quickly and bounces off so that the string is free to vibrate and make a sound When the player takes his finger off the key the damper falls back onto the string and the sound stops The strings are stretched very tightly across the frame passing over a bridge  on the way The bridge touches the soundboard This means that the vibrations are sent to the soundboard The soundboard is a very important part of the piano If it is damaged the piano will not make a sound,0 0 0 0 Keyboard_instrument 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vibrate 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A farmhouse may look like a cottage a bungalow or a mansion but in many countries a farmhouse can look quite different to a house in a town because as well as having a place for people to live it also has a place for animals Three typical types of farmhouses are found Many farm houses are long and have two doors One door leads to the rooms used by the family The other door opens into a stable for the cows sheep and chickens The stable part often has a loft where hay can be kept to feed the animals in the winter Another type of farmhouse has two storeys with a big stable and storeroom underneath with the rooms for the family on the upper floor Another type of farmhouse has buildings such as the family house the barn and the stable all joined together around a central courtyard Old farmhouses of these three types can be found in many parts of Europe and Great Britain,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Stable 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Houses are usually built from types of material that can easily be made or bought near the place where the house is built Because of this old houses in different towns and different villages look quite different to each other even in the same country In modern times building materials can be transported easily and this means that a builder has much more choice about the types of material to use for a house,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In many parts of the world mud or clay are the main building materials Clay is a type of soil that sticks together more strongly than most other types of soil There are three main ways of building walls with mud and clay,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
One way to make a house of clay is simply to pile up the mud or wet clay with the hands and flatten it into a wall shape Often animal hair straw and dung is mixed with the mud so that the fibres help hold it together Some wooden beams and thin wooden slats are used to hold the roof which is also made of mud or clay The roof is flat and strong enough to walk on but must slope a bit in case of rain The walls are often protected from rain with plaster and paint In many countries the walls are usuallly white but in other places all the houses are painted different bright clolours These types of houses are only found in very dry countries Houses built in this way give good protection against the very hot sun and hot dry winds of the dessert In the cold nights they stay quite warm,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Houses made of timber are found wherever there are or there has once been big forests Timber houses are also often found in seaside towns where the sea air makes brick and stone houses feel cold and damp,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Some of the oldest houses in the world are made of stone They are circular houses with walls of flat stone slabs laid carefully on each other The walls sloped gently inwards to meet in a stone roof Other prehistoric stone houses had roofs of thatch,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The good thing about the types of stone that are used for grand houses is that they can easily be carved into decoration Grand houses often have decorative carvings around the doors and windows The building stones may also have special textures at the basement or the corners of the building,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

For example thanks to the work of scientists including Galileo Galilei and Albert Einstein we know that position and motion are relativity This means that everything s position depends on where they exist in relation to other things For example a ball is 5 Foot  away from a box 3 feet away from a chair and a foot away from a Table  According to Einstein the ball s position means how far the ball is from other things so by telling you how far the ball was from other things I told you its position An object s movement is also relative Its movement depends on where it is in relation to other things and where it s going to in relation to other things,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Galileo_Galilei 0 Albert_Einstein 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Relativity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Box 0 0 0 0 0 Chair 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The brain has several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord At the highest level is the primary motor cortex a strip of tissue at the back edge of the frontal lobe This tissue sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord through the pyramidal tract This allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements There are other brain areas which affect movement Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex basal ganglia and cerebellum,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cerebellum

People like bonsai because it is nice to look at and because it is fun to grow a bonsai tree A bonsai tree can live for a very long time longer than a person can live In a family a bonsai might be started by a grandparent then given to a parent then given to a child over many years,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

To make the bonsai the small tree is taken out of the ground Its roots are carefully cleaned of dirt The roots may be trimmed a little to help them fit in a small pot The branches may also be trimmed to make the tree smaller Then it is put in a bonsai pot which has low sides Fresh soil is put in the pot to cover the bonsai tree s roots Then it is watered and put outdoors to live,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The art of bonsai began in Japan over one thousand years ago It was brought to Japan from China around the year 800 A D At first bonsai were planted in large pots like the Chinese used But the Japanese later put them in very low almost flat pots This change made the tree itself the most important thing in the art form not the fancy pot or small houses or statues of people which other nations used with their small trees in pots,0 0 0 0 0 0 Japan 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 China 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
At first only the rich and noble people of Japan had bonsai One family could have many bonsai which would grow in pots in the garden outside of the house A servant might take care of all the bonsai and would learn a lot about how to grow bonsai The rules about how to grow a bonsai properly were not well known and were not shared with other people Later more people began to grow bonsai Some were holy people like monks Some were Japanese families who were not noble or really rich but who had enough money and time to grow one or two bonsai in their gardens or house yards This larger group of people began to share what they learned about the rules of bonsai and so more people could join in growing bonsai By the twentieth century the rules of bonsai were very well known in Japan and many people could afford to grow their own bonsai,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A tree that could be used for bonsai is not small in nature If left to grow in the open soil a bonsai tree would grow as big as any other tree But in a pot the tree will not grow very big To help keep it small the owner of the bonsai trims its leaves and branches every year Every two or three years the bonsai owner lifts the bonsai out of its pot and trims the roots Then the owner puts the bonsai back in its pot with some new soil,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A bonsai grower checks the soil of every bonsai pot once every day If the soil is nearly dry the grower waters it until it is wet from the top of the soil to the bottom of the pot Every few weeks the grower adds a little fertilizer to each bonsai tree s soil In the winter this happens less often,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A bonsai can live to be older than a large tree of the same species if it is grown with care A bonsai needs good care and a bonsai with poor care will not be healthy and might die To keep a bonsai strong it must grow outdoors like a real tree It must never get too dry or stay too wet It must never get too hot or too cold If it gets a plant sickness like a fungus it must be cured quickly If it gets bugs like aphids the bugs must be cleaned off or killed quickly,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Species 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fungus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Aphids 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The metabolic system of an organism decides which substances it finds nutrition and which poisonous For example some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient yet this gas is poisonous to animals The speed of metabolism the metabolic rate influences how much food an organism will need and how it is able to get that food,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nutrition 0 0 Poisonous 0 0 0 Prokaryotes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Socrates was one of the greatest Ancient Greece philosophers He did not propose any specific knowledge or policy He showed how argument debate and discussion could help men to understand difficult issues Most of the issues he dealt with were only political on the surface Underneath they were moral questions about how life should be lived Plato The last days of Socrates Translation and introduction by Hugh Tredennick Penguin London Such is the influence of Socrates that philosophers before him are called the Presocratic philosophers Guthrie W K C 1962 A history of Greek philosophy Cambridge University Press London Volume 1 The earlier presocratics and the pythagoreans Volume 2 The presocratic tradition from Parmenides to Democritus,0 0 0 0 0 0 Ancient_Greece Philosophers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Argument Debate 0 Discussion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Political 0 0 0 0 0 0 Moral 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Plato 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Presocratic 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Parmenides 0 Democritus
Socrates made enemies three of whom brought charges against him Socrates was tried for his life in 399 BC found guilty and put to death by drinking hemlock The story of his trial and death is the subject of a tract by Plato which is called the Apologia,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hemlock 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Plato 0 0 0 0 0
Socrates never wrote anything All of what we know about Socrates is from what other people wrote about him Our main source of what we know about Socrates is from the writings of his student Plato Some of Plato s dialogues such as the Crito and the Phaedo are loosely based on fact They are not written records but artistic re creation of Socrates in action,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Plato 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Another of Socrates students Xenophon also wrote about Socrates Aristophanes a person who wrote brilliant Satire Comedy wrote about him in play called The Clouds Socrates was an easy target for satire He walked barefoot and with a swagger Sometimes he stood in a trance for hours p8 In The Clouds Socrates is a crazy person who tries to scam people out of their money Plato wrote that Socrates taught for free,0 0 0 0 Xenophon 0 0 0 0 Aristophanes 0 0 0 0 0 Satire Comedy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
We do not know if Plato s description of Socrates is accurate or not That is called the Socratic problem While a lot of what Plato wrote about Socrates is accepted by historians some believe that Plato portrayed Socrates as a greater man than he actually was Some think that Plato was using the character of Socrates as a tool to express his own opinions rather than to accurately write about Socrates This is what makes Socrates such a mysterious historical figure Plato s dialogues are works of art finely written The general view is that they are based on reality but no doubt adjusted for the purpose of writing,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Socrates father was a sculptor and his mother was a midwife who helped women give birth to children He may have been a stonemason like his father and Plato wrote that he served in the Athenian army as a hoplite We know he was influenced by an older philosopher Archelaus and that he talked with anyone who had interesting ideas in Athens but beyond that nothing is known,0 0 0 0 Sculptor 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hoplite 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Socrates was about 50 when he married a much younger woman Xanthippe They had three children together Socrates made about his wife but no one knew if he was telling the truth,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
It is said that one of Socrates friends went to ask the oracle at Delphi  Greece if there was anyone wiser than Socrates in Athens The oracle said that there was no wiser person The oracle was well known for saying things that were ambiguous or unclear It did not say that Socrates was the wisest just that there was no person wiser,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Oracle 0 Delphi 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ambiguous 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
After being puzzled by this Socrates finally decided that his wisdom lay in knowing that he was ignorant His attempts to show the citizens that some of their ideas were nonsense might help explain his unpopularity In Plato s works Socrates says he knows nothing but can draw out other people s ideas just as his mother helped other women to give birth,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
There were two charges against him The general theme was that Socrates was a menace to society The first charge was of heresy disbelief in the Gods It was probably meant to cause prejudice amongst the jurymen Actually Socrates observed all the correct procedures of the religion of his times The charge had been used successfully against another philosopher Anaxagoras p17,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Prejudice 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Anaxagoras 0
Crito a friend of Socrates illegally paid the prison guards to allow Socrates to escape Socrates however decided not to escape When Socrates was put on trial he gave a long speech to defend himself against the claims made by the Athens government,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When Socrates was asked to propose his punishment Socrates said that the government should give him free dinners for the rest of his life for all the good that he did for society The court held a vote between giving Socrates a fine to pay or putting him to death The verdict was that Socrates was to be put to death,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Socrates did not fear death He did not try to avoid death by apologizing for his actions because he thought it was morally right to stand by his principles Socrates was ordered to drink a cup of hemlock Hemlock is got from any of the poisonous umbelliferous plants of the genera Conium and Cicuta He drank it and died soon after,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hemlock 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
People think that Socrates was a good man because he did no harm except he asked questions about everything However during his life many people thought he was a bad person because he asked those questions and because he made young people unhappy about their lives,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Socrates also taught that many people can look at something and not truly see it He asked questions about the meaning of life and goodness These are still very important questions Much of philosophy is about these things,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Socrates is known as one of the most important philosophers in history He is often described as the father of Western philosophy He did not start Western philosophy but he had a big influence on it Before Socrates philosophy was mainly about mathematics and answering questions about our natural world Socrates expanded on that and added questions about ethics politics and epistemology to philosophy,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ethics Politics 0 Epistemology 0 0
Physiology is the study of how Life work Physiologists can study how Organ  of an organism work together to make things happen In human beings for example the digestion of food hormones and other chemicals are made by the stomach liver and pancreas Muscle contraction happens because of chemical messages made by nerves of that muscle By learning how the body functions normally physiologists and physicians can better understand what happens when organs do not function normally For example an understanding of how the thyroid gland functions has helped in treating goitre Studies of the circulatory system and the nervous system have helped physicians understand and treat such illnesses like heart disease Stroke  and high blood pressure,0 0 0 0 0 0 Life 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Organism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Digestion 0 Food Hormones 0 0 Chemicals 0 0 0 0 Stomach Liver 0 Pancreas Muscle 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nerves 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Goitre 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 High_Blood_Pressure

A deadline is a time by which some must be d,0 0 0 0 Time 0 0 0 0 0 0
Very often it means a time limit that is set in place by an authority for example a teacher tells students that they must turn in their in by a certain time This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her principal that every student had the same chance to do the work,0 0 0 0 0 Time_Limit 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Authority 0 0 0 Teacher 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Principal 0 0 Student 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Deadlines may also be set by a time horizon that comes from something that is not a human authority but part of nature For example by sunset one must do those tasks requiring daylight However a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Time_Horizon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nature 0 0 0 Sunset 0 0 0 0 0 0 Daylight 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the Matter horizon where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this A deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Matter Horizon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy observational and theoretical astronomy Observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to or look at stars galaxies and other astronomical objects Theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to predict what should happen The two often work together the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Telescopes 0 Cameras 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Maths 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars They made maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and calendars to work out the time of year Early civilisations such as the Maya civilization people and the Ancient Egyptians built simple observatory and drew maps of the stars positions They also began to think about the place of Earth in the universe For a long time people thought Earth was the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun went around it This is known as geocentrism,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Maps 0 0 Constellations 0 0 0 0 0 0 Calendars 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Maya_civilization 0 0 0 Ancient_Egyptians 0 0 Observatory 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earth 0 0 Universe 0 0 0 0 0 0 Earth 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Geocentrism

During the renaissance a priest named Nicolaus Copernicus thought from looking at the way the planets moved that the Earth was not the center of everything Based on previous works he said that the Earth was a planet and all the planets moved around the sun This brought back the old idea of heliocentrism A physicist called Galileo Galilei built his own telescopes and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time He agreed with Copernicus The Catholic Church decided that Galileo was wrong He had to spend the rest of his life under house arrest Heliocentric ideas were soon improved by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton who invented the theory of gravity,0 0 Renaissance 0 0 0 Nicolaus_Copernicus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Planet 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Galileo_Galilei 0 0 0 Telescopes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Catholic_Church 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 House_Arrest 0 0 0 0 0 0 Johannes_Kepler 0 Isaac_Newton 0 0 0 Theory 0 Gravity

In 1931 Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy allowing more discoveries to be made,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The opening of this new window on the Universe saw the discovery of entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Universe 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The period after World War 2 saw more observatory where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites normally by governments For example Bernard Lovell began radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank using leftover military radar equipment By 1957 the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world Similarly the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at Mauna Kea in Hawaii a good site for visible and infra red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies,0 0 0 World_War_2 0 0 Observatory 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bernard_Lovell 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Radar 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mauna_Kea 0 Hawaii 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Red 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

There are way astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens Light from a distant source reaches a sensor and gets measured normally by a human eye or a camera For very dim sources there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sensor 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Telescopes at most observatories can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures Also images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours days or even months In the digital era digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer which overlays the images after correcting for movement,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Computer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Other letters are C for non periodic comets and X for comets where we do not know their orbits It uses A for objects people say are asteroids Each name starts with a number so two comets have the same name,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In a modern republic the head of state is a president usually election by the people or by a parliament In a monarchy the head of state is the king or queen Some countries have different systems for example the head of state of the Vatican City is the Pope,0 0 0 Republic 0 0 0 0 0 0 President 0 Election 0 0 0 0 0 0 Parliament 0 0 Monarchy 0 0 0 0 0 0 King 0 Queen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vatican_City 0 0 Pope
In a modern monarchy the head of state usually has little real power Instead the most powerful person is the head of government This is usually the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in an election In these cases the king is considered to be the leader of the country but must always take the decisions that the head of government advises them to make The king or queen carries out national ceremonies The United Kingdom works like this with the Prime minister heading the government,0 0 0 Monarchy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Political_Party 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Election 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 United_Kingdom 0 0 0 0 0 Prime_Minister 0 0 0
A president may be the most powerful person in the country This is true in the United States However sometimes there is a head of government as well as a president The president then acts very much like a king or queen leaving the real decisions to the head of government The Republic of Ireland works like this,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 United_States 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Republic_of_Ireland 0 0 0

The speed of light in vacuum Space  is a universal physical constant This means it is the same everywhere in empty space and does not change with time Physicists often use the letter to denote the speed of light in empty space It has the value 299 792 458 metre per second A photon travels at this speed in a vacuum,0 0 0 0 0 Vacuum 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Metre 0 Second 0 Photon 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vacuum
Another method is to use the aberration of light discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source and the velocity of its observer A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position Since the direction of the Earth s velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around From the angular difference in the position of stars at most 20 5 arcseconds,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 James_Bradley 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The relative uncertainty in these measurements is 0 02 parts per billion equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth based measurements of length by interferometry,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Since the metre is defined to be the length travelled by light in a certain time interval the measurement of the light time for unit distance can also be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU in metres The metre is considered to be a unit of proper length whereas the AU is usually used as a unit of observed length in a given frame of reference,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The finite speed of light is a major constraint on long distance space travel Supposing a journey to the other side of the Milky Way the total time for a message and its reply would be about 200 000 years Even more seriously no spacecraft could travel faster than light so all galactic scale transport would be effectively one way and would take much longer than than any modern civilisation has existed,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Milky_Way 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Civilisation 0 0
Biochemistry is the study of chemical reactions in living beings and of biological molecules in general It is important to cell biology and physiology The study of biochemistry involves enzymes nucleic acids carbohydrates sugars proteins and lipids In the body most of the molecules are polymers built of long chains of carbon atoms with hydrogen oxygen and other atoms added,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cell_Biology 0 Physiology 0 0 0 0 0 Enzymes 0 Carbohydrates Sugars Proteins 0 Lipids 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Polymers 0 0 0 0 0 Carbon 0 0 Hydrogen Oxygen 0 0 0 0

Enzymes are special types of protein which greatly speed up the chemical reactions in a living thing Their function is to speed up and help chemical reactions by lowering the enzyme s activation energy There are a few enzymes that are not proteins but instead made of RNA which are called ribozymes and are in fact nucleic acids,Enzymes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 RNA 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Lipids are fats and waxes Saturated lipids contain single chemical bond and are found in butter and lard Unsaturated lipids have one or more double bonds and are often found in oils The human body stores lipids as an energy source When the body needs a large amount of energy lipid molecules are broken down to release that energy,Lipids 0 Fats 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Butter 0 Lard 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Human_Body 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Dimensions are the way we see measure and experience our world By Using up and down right to left back to front hot and cold how heavy and how long as well as more advanced concepts from mathematics and physics One way to define a dimension is to look at the degree of freedom or the way an object can move in a specific space There are different concepts or ways where the term dimension is used and there are also different definitions There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mathematics 0 Physics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The God paradox is a good example of a philosophy This section has some answers to this paradox,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Philosophy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
One answer is that God could make it so he can t lift the mountain by his own choice In other words God can lift the unliftable mountain because he is all powerful but he chooses not to be able to and so he chooses to cut his own power because he is able God can also choose to not be able to create such a mountain God is all powerful so he can choose not to have the power to make an unliftable mountain Simply said God can cut his own power but in so doing he can still regain that power It is a limbo a state between not powerful and powerful something that is not definable by our knowledge of what is possible or impossible Because God is allmighty he surpasses our definitions of what he can and cannot do,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
God is beyond limitation His strength is infinite If He chooses to create a mountain that is too heavy for Him to lift he would simultaneously become strong enough to lift it To ask if the creation of such a mountain is possible is to attempt putting a limitation on the limitless,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The most common type of fluke anchors is the Danforth The Danforth style uses a stock at the crown to which two large flat flukes are attached The stock can rotate so the flukes can move toward the bottom It can hold very well but has difficulty setting on its own It is efficient for its weight,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Seeds have been an important development in the and spread of conifers and flowering plants Plants such as mosses liverworts and ferns do not have seeds and use unprotected spores and other methods to themselves Before the upper Devonian period land plants like modern ferns reproduced by sending spores into the air The spores would land and become new plants only in favourable conditions Spores have little food stored and may be just single cells rather than embryos,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Conifers 0 0 0 0 0 Mosses Liverworts 0 Ferns 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Spores 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Devonian 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The evolution of seeds changed the plant life cycle by freeing plants from the need for external water for sexual reproduction and by providing protection and nutrients for the developing embryo These functions allowed plants to expand beyond the immediate neighbourhood of water sources They were able to exploit environments which were drier and more upland Willis K J and McElwain J C 2002 The evolution of plants Oxford p92 This can be seen by the success of seed plants in important biological Ecological niches on land from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates The present day seed plants are the Gymnosperms with naked seeds and the Angiosperms with covered seeds usually fruits,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Forests 0 Grasslands 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gymnosperms 0 0 0 0 0 Angiosperms 0 0 0 0 0
Albert Einstein had sought a unified field theory a single model to explain the fundamental interactions or mechanics of the universe Today s search is for a unified field theory that is quantized and that explains matter s structure too This is called the search for a theory of everything The most prominent contender as a TOE is string theory converted into superstring theory with its six higher dimension s in addition to the 4D,Albert_Einstein 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dimension 0 0 0 0 0 4D

In 1915 the universe was thought to be entirely what we now call the Milky Way galaxy and to be static Einstein operated his recently published general theory of relativity and discovered the consequence that the universe was expanding or shrinking He revised the theory add a cosmological constant to arbitrarily balance the universe Nearing 1930 Edwin Hubble s telescopic data interpreted through general relativity revealed the universe was expanding,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Milky_Way 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In 1916 while on a World War I battlefield Karl Schwarzschild operated Einstein s equations and the Schwarzschild solution predicted black holes Decades later astrophysicists identified a supermassive black hole in the center of perhaps every galaxy Black holes seem to lead galaxy formation and maintenance by regulating star formation and destruction,0 0 0 0 0 World_War_I 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the slit experiment an electron would travel through one hole placed in front of it Yet a single electron would travel simultaneously though multiple holes however many were placed in front of it The single electron would leave on the detection board an interference pattern as if the single particle were a wave that had passed through all the holes simultaneously And yet this occurred only when unobserved If light were shone on the expected event the photon s interaction with the field would set the electron to a single position,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Setting the field to special relativity permitted prediction of the complete electromagnetic field Thus arose relativistic quantum field theory Of the electromagnetic field it is relativistic quantum electrodynamics Of the weak and electromagnetic fields together it is relativistic electroweak theory Of the strong field it is relativistic quantum chromodynamics Altogether this became the Standard Model of particle physics,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Standard_Model 0 0
String theory began as bosonic string theory whose 26 dimensions act as many fewer Yet this modeled only bosons which are energy particles while omitting fermions which are matter particles So bosonic string theory could not explain matter Yet by adding supersymmetry to bosonic string theory fermions were achieved and string theory became super string theory explaining matter too,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

General relativity has brought many discoveries that in 1915 were all but unimaginable except in fiction A solution of Einstein s equations that sought to explain quantum particles dynamics the Einstein Rosen Bridge predicts a shortcut connecting two distant points in spacetime Commonly called a wormhole the Einstein Rosen Bridge is doubted but not disproved showing either that not all consequences of a theory must be accurate or that reality is quite bizarre in ways unobservable,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Einstein 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

One way of showing the molecule is by drawing its structural formula Because molecules can have complicated structures people have made ways to show them in simple language One way is to use line diagrams Each atom is shown by a letter and connected by a line to each atom with which it is has a covalent bond One line means a single bond two lines means a double bond and so on,0 0 0 0 0 Molecule 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Because there is in an infinite number of possible organic compounds language is needed to give a unique name to each one The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry or IUPAC made a system for doing this Although an IUPAC name makes every single possible molecule unique the names are often long and complicated so in everyday life trivial names unofficial but widely understood names are used such as the trivial names Paracetamol Tylenol and Acetaminophen which are used for a compound whose IUPAC name is N acetamide Some of these trivial names are trademarks,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 IUPAC 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Paracetamol 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Acetamide 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Weather happens because different parts of the Earth get different amounts of heat from the Sun This makes different climates The tropics get the most heat because the Sun shines straight down on them while the poles get the least heat because the Sun shines on them from a low angle Warmer air is lighter than cooler air and rises higher in the sky by convection,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Heat 0 0 Sun 0 0 0 0 0 Tropics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Poles 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Angle 0 Air 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Convection
The air always has some water mixed with it This is called humidity When it cools the water can change from a gas to a liquid through condensation Then the water can fall from the sky as rain or snow After the air rises it gets colder and goes back towards the ground Because the air lost its water before it is dry when it comes back to the ground When two air mass es of different temperatures meet this is called a warm front or cold front The ways that the air moves around the Earth are called atmospheric circulation,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Humidity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gas 0 0 Liquid 0 Condensation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rain 0 Snow 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Temperatures 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Measurement is a process that uses numbers to describe a physical quantity based on what we can observation This is done to be able to compare them to each other We can measure how big things are how warm they are how heavy they are and lots of other features as well Units of Measurement provide standards for our comparisons so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing,Measurement 0 0 0 0 0 Numbers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Observation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
For example the metre is a standard unit to measure length Before 1982 it was defined as the distance between two markers on a special rod Now scientists define the metre by using the speed of light Saying something has a length of 2 metres means that it is exactly twice as long as that rod used to define the metre or that light takes twice the time defined for a metre to travel that distance,0 0 0 Metre 0 0 0 0 0 0 Length 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Imperial units were defined in the United Kingdom in 1825 These units sometimes based on similar units that were in use before 1825 Imperial units were used in countries that were part of the British Empire While many of these countries including the United Kingdom have officially adopted SI the older system of units are still used,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 British_Empire 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
US customary units are the official units used in the US These are similar to the British imperial units and also based on the units used in the United Kingdom from before American Revolution Some of the units are different to the British ones For example there are 20 imperial fluid ounces in an imperial pint but 16 US fluid ounces in a US pint Additionally the US fluid ounce is slightly bigger than the imperial fluid ounce The result is that US pints and gallons are smaller than imperial pints and gallons In the United States the metric system has been legal for trade since 1866 but other measurements such as the gallon inch and the pound are still widely used,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 American_Revolution 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A physical change is a change in which no new substances are formed Physical changes affect the of a chemical substance but not its chemical composition Mixtures can be separated into their parts by physical methods such as spinning in a centrifuge It cannot be used to separate compounds into chemical elements or simpler compounds,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Centrifuge 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Many physical changes also involve the rearrangement of atoms most noticeably in the formation of crystals Many chemical changes are irreversible and many physical changes are reversible but reversibility is not a certain criterion for classification Although chemical changes may be recognized by an indication such as odor color change or production of a gas every one of these indicators can result from physical change,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In a liquid molecules are attracted to each other strongly enough to keep them in contact but not strongly enough to hold a particular structure The molecules can continually move with respect to each other This means that liquids can flow smoothly but not as smoothly as gases Liquids will tend to take the shape of a container that they are in Liquids are generally less dense than solids but denser than gases,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In a gas the chemical bonds are not strong enough to hold atoms or molecules together and from this a gas is a collection of independent unbonded molecules which interact mainly by collision Gases tend to take the shape of their container and are less dense than both solids and liquids,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Collision 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Gases can sometimes turn directly into solids without passing through a liuid stage That is called desublimation You see it in the hoary frost which forms on window panes in cold climates It is the reverse of sublimation,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Desublimation 0 0 0 0 0 0 Frost 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sublimation

Because the positive and negative electric charge particles are not stuck together plasma is a good conduction of electricity For example air is not good at conducting electricity However in a bolt of lightning the atoms in air get so much energy that they no longer can hold on to their electrons and become a plasma for a brief time Then an electric current is able to flow through the plasma making the lightning,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Conduction 0 Electricity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lightning 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

When the core of a star runs out of light elements to sustain fusion the core will collapse into a very dense state called degenerate matter Everything is packed very tightly and can barely move If the star isn t too heavy it becomes a white dwarf In a heavier star the pressure is so intense that even the protons and electrons are crushed and it becomes a neutron star,0 0 0 0 0 Star 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fusion 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Protons 0 Electrons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Condoms are popular for several reasons They are inexpensive and can be bought without a prescription by either a man or a woman They can be bought at many locations and they are easy to use They have no health related side effects for either the man or the woman and they are one of the few types of birth control that also reduce the spread of infections If the couple decides to have a baby they can stop using condoms at any time and begin trying to get pregnant with no delay,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
But condoms have some disadvantages During sex the couple must stop to put on the condom just before beginning intercourse which interrupts and distracts them at an exciting time Condoms reduce the physical feelings of intercourse especially for the man who cannot feel the heat and sensation of the woman s vagina as much Condoms can also reduce the emotional closeness the man and woman feel during intercourse because there is something between them Condoms are less effective than many other types of birth control and if a couple is in a steady relationship and are having sex very often condoms can become more expensive to use For these reasons once a man and woman are in a steady relationship and are sure they are free of infection the woman often begins to use Combined oral contraceptive pill  or some other highly effective birth control  after which the couple stops using condoms,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vagina 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Some of the machines that make radiation are called particle accelerators Scientists use these machines to make radiation so they can study it X ray machines also make radiation so doctors can see the inside of the human body and help people Nuclear weapons use a nuclear reaction to produce massive amounts of energy in the form of heat light and radiation This radiation is spread by the dust ash and smoke produced by the blast,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X Ray 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Human_Body 0 0 0 Nuclear_weapons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Nuclear reactors are used to make electricity They make a lot of radiation but the reactors are built carefully to keep the radiation inside the reactor But many people are afraid that if there were a problem with the reactor radioactive material could escape into the environment harming or killing many animals and people Also the parts of the reactor stay radioactive and can kill people for hundreds or thousands of years so people are not sure where they can keep parts of old reactors safely away from people,Nuclear_reactors 0 0 0 0 Electricity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The sky is what we call the appearance of the atmosphere around the surface of the planet from our point of view We see many objects that are actually in space such as the Sun the Moon and stars because they are in the sky On a clear day the sky appears blue At night it appears The deepness of the blue increases as we look toward the horizon and up to the point above us,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Atmosphere 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Blue 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Horizon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The sky which is made up of gas molecules is blue because of the random scattering of sunlight by the molecules Rayleigh scattering defines the amount of scattering of light rays Blue light scatters much more than red which is why the sky appears blue on a clear day Depending on the time of day the sky may appear different colors At Sunrise or Sunset the sky may appear red orange or even green and purple depending on how low the sun is and how close it is to night,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Molecules 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rayleigh_scattering 0 0 0 0 0 0 Light 0 Blue 0 0 0 0 0 Red 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sunrise 0 Sunset 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

If there are not rivers flowing out of the lake or they are few and small the lake loses water only by evaporation or because the water flows through the soil pores Where the water evaporates rapidly and the soil around the lake has a high salt level as in very dry places the water of the lake has a high concentration of salt and the lake is called a salt lake Examples of salt lakes are the Great Salt Lake the Caspian Sea the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Evaporation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Soil Pores 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Salt 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Concentration 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Great_Salt_Lake 0 Caspian_Sea 0 Aral_Sea 0 0 Dead_Sea

Viruses are much smaller than bacterium They were not visible until the invention of the electron microscope A virus has a simple structure It has no internal cellular structure no cell wall or cell membrane just the protein coat that holds the string of nucleic acid,0 0 0 0 0 Bacterium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Protein 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
With eukaryote cells the virus protein coat is able to enter the target cells certain cell membrane receptors With prokaryote bacteria cells the bacteriophage physically injects the nucleic acid strand into the host cell,0 Eukaryote 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bacteria 0 0 Bacteriophage 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When the host cell has finished making more viruses it undergoes lysis or breaks apart The viruses are released and are then able to infect other cells Viruses can remain intact for a long time and will infect cells when the time and conditions are right,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some special viruses are worth noting Bacteriophages have evolved to enter bacterial cells which have a different type of cell wall from eukaryote cell membranes Envelope viruses when they reproduce cover themselves with a modified form of the host cell membrane thus gaining an outer lipid layer that helps entry Some of our most difficult to combat viruses like influenza and HIV use this method,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bacterial 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lipid 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Influenza 0 HIV 0 0 0
Viral infections in animals trigger an immune response which usually kills the infecting virus Vaccines can also produce immune responses They give an artificially Adaptive immune system to the specific viral infection However some viruses escape from these immune responses and cause chronic infections Antibiotics have no effect on viruses but there are some other drugs against viruses,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vaccines 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Adaptive_immune_system 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Antibiotics 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Viral populations do not grow through cell division because they do not have cells Instead they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce many copies of themselves and they assemble in the cell,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Attachment is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Capsid 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Following the structure mediated self assembly of the virus particles some modification of the proteins often occurs In viruses such as HIV this modification occurs after the virus has been released from the host cell,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 HIV 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The genetic material within virus particles and the method by which the material is replicated varies considerably between different types of viruses,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The body s first line of defence against viruses is the innate immune system This has cells and other mechanisms which defend the host from any infection The cells of the innate system recognise and respond to pathogens in a general way,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
RNA interference is an important innate defence against viruses Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double stranded RNA When such a virus infects a cell it releases its RNA molecule A protein complex called dicer sticks to it and chops the RNA into pieces Then a biochemical pathway called the RISC complex starts up This attacks the viral mRNA and the cell survives the infection,RNA_interference 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

An atom is the basic unit of matter It is the smallest thing that can have a chemical property There are many different types of atoms each with its own name atomic mass and size These different atoms are called chemical elements The chemical elements are organized on the periodic table Examples of elements are hydrogen and gold,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Matter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hydrogen 0 Gold
Atoms are very small but the exact size depends on the element Atoms range from 0 1 to 0 5 nanometers in width One nanometer is about 100 000 times smaller than the width of a human hair This makes atoms impossible to see without special tools Scientists use experiments to learn how they work and interact with other atoms,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hair 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Scientists 0 Experiments 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Every atom is made up of three kinds of smaller particles called protons neutrons and electrons The protons and neutrons are heavier and stay in the middle of the atom They are called the atomic nucleus They are surrounded by a cloud of electrons which are very light in weight and are attracted to the positive charge of the nucleus This attraction is called electromagnetic force,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Protons Neutrons 0 Electrons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electromagnetic 0

In 1777 France chemist Antoine Lavoisier defined the term element for the first time He said that an chemical element was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry Any substance that could be broken down was a Chemical compound,0 0 France 0 Antoine_Lavoisier 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chemical_compound
In 1803 England philosopher John Dalton suggested that elements were tiny solid balls made of atoms Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine According to Dalton in a certain compound the atoms of the compound s elements always combine the same way,0 0 England 0 John_Dalton 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In 1827 British scientist Robert Brown looked at pollen grains in water under his microscope The pollen grains appeared to be jiggling Brown used Dalton s atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved This was called brownian motion In 1905 Albert Einstein used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were caused by the reactions of atoms and by doing this he conclusively proved the existence of the atom,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pollen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Albert_Einstein 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Elements in the same column or period usually have similar properties For example helium neon argon krypton and xenon are all in the same column and have very similar properties All these elements are gases that have no colour and no smell Also they are unable to combine with other atoms to form compounds Together they are known as the noble gases,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Helium Neon Argon Krypton 0 Xenon 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gases 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

For example any atom with 2 protons should be a helium atom Usually a helium Nucleus  also contains two neutrons However some helium atoms have only one neutron This means they truly are helium because an element is defined by the number of protons but they are not normal helium either Soddy called an atom like this with a different number of neutrons an isotope To get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its Nucleus  and add this to the name of the element So a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium 3 and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon 12 However when he developed his theory Soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed To prove they were real physicist James Chadwick and a team of others created the mass spectrometer The mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms By doing this Chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom neutrons must exist,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Helium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Isotope 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Further into the 20th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom Using particle accelerators they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles called quarks,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Quarks
Electrons are by far the smallest of the three atomic particles their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology They have a negative Electric charge Protons and neutrons are of similar size and weight to each other protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electric_charge 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The nucleus is in the middle of an atom It is made up of protons and neutrons Usually in nature two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other So for a long time it was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together They solved this by finding a particle called a gluon Its name comes from the word glue as gluons act like atomic glue sticking the protons together using the strong nuclear force It is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gluon 0 0 0 0 0 0 Glue 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through radioactive decay When there are too many neutrons or protons the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles It does this by emitting radiation in the form of alpha particle beta particle or gamma ray decay Nuclei can change through other means too Nuclear fission is when the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei releasing a lot of stored energy This release of energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making bombs and electricity in the form of nuclear power,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gamma_Ray 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Nuclear_fission 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Energy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electricity 0 0 0 0 Nuclear_Power
The other way nuclei can change is through nuclear fusion when two nuclei join together or fuse to make a heavier nucleus This process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons as they have the same charge Such high energies are most common in stars like our Sun which fuses hydrogen for fuel,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Stars 0 0 Sun 0 0 0 0 0
Electrons orbit or travel around the nucleus They are called the atom s electron cloud They are attracted towards the nucleus because of the electromagnetism Electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge so they attract each other,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Electromagnetism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others in different layers These are called electron shells In most atoms the first shell has two electrons and all after that have eight Exceptions are rare but they do happen and are difficult to predict The further away the electron is from the nucleus the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it This is why bigger atoms with more electrons react more easily with other atoms,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Alpha decay is when the atom shoots out a particle having two protons and two neutrons This is essentially a helium nucleus The result is an element with atomic number two less than before So for example if a beryllium atom went through alpha decay it would become helium Alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass,Alpha_decay 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Helium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Beryllium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Beta decay is when a neutron turns into a proton or a proton turns into a neutron In the first case the atom shoots out an electron In the second case it is a positron The end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before Beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons or too many neutrons,Beta_decay 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Positron 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Gamma ray is when an atom shoots out a gamma ray or wave It happens when there is a change in the energy of the nucleus This is usually after a nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay There is no change in the mass or atomic number or the atom only in the stored energy inside the nucleus,Gamma_Ray 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gamma_Ray 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Energy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Every radioactive element or isotope has what is named a half life  This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element Large atoms or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life because they must lose more neutrons to become stable,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A radio telescope is a type of antenna like a huge satellite television dish It is used for radio astronomy Stars shine and the light can be seen with an ordinary telescope but they also give off radio waves Scientists with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use computers to learn about the stars Other things like black holes also give off radio waves and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Antenna 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Telescope 0 0 0 0 0 0 Scientists 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Computers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Black_Holes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes so even very faint signals can be received Scientists are also trying to do this with ordinary telescopes,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Conductive 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Nuclear explosions can destroy a city and kill most of its people They also make nuclear fallout that may also make people very sick Nuclear weapons are the most damaging weapons to have been created,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In the years after 1895 people studying physics begin to understand how atoms are made Around 1915 people began to have the idea that breaking special atoms can release large quantities of energy and can be used to make a bomb,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Physics 0 0 0 0 Atoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bomb
By August 1945 the Manhattan Project built three nuclear fission weapons Two of these bombs were used by the United States to attack the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan People from the Manhattan Project believe that around 105 000 people were killed and 94 000 were hurt when the bombs were used from the Atomic Archive retrieved on 27 December 2014,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hiroshima 0 Nagasaki 0 Japan 0 0 0 Manhattan_Project 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

One way that nuclear weapons release energy is by breaking atoms apart This is called nuclear fission and is the basis for atomic bombs Specific isotopes of uranium or plutonium are typically used in these weapons These elements can be made to undergo nuclear fission and have a nuclear chain reaction,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Atoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Uranium 0 Plutonium 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Another process can be used to create nuclear weapons that create even bigger explosions and release much more energy by fusing atoms together This process is called nuclear fusion and weapons based on this process are called hydrogen bombs or thermonuclear weapons Specialized isotopes of hydrogen are typically used in these weapons,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Atoms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hydrogen 0 0 0 0 0 0
Nuclear weapons produce a very large amount of energy and radiation which can kill people or animals within several kilometers Most of the radiation is X rays which heats the air to produce a huge nuclear fireball The rapid expansion of the fireball creates a dangerous shock wave that can destroy houses or buildings several kilometers away The radiation can cause radiation poisoning and also has the potential to cause mutations in the DNA which can cause cancer,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Energy 0 Radiation 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X Rays 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Nuclear bombs also release fallout which is nuclear material and dust that has been irradiated and become radioactive Over time the radioactive fallout can potentially kill people farther away depending on how much was released Fallout from a nuclear explosion can be blown by the wind large distances from where the explosion occurred and can remain dangerous for long periods of time,0 0 0 0 Fallout 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A hydrogen bomb also known as a fusion bomb is a nuclear weapon which utilizes hydrogen isotopes in addition to uranium or plutonium Hydrogen bombs have the potential to be much more powerful than fission bombs Despite the name a typical hydrogen bomb only has enough hydrogen to produce additional neutrons to detonate a casing made of natural uranium The fuel in hydrogen bombs is thus mostly unrefined uranium,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hydrogen Isotopes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Neutrons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Nuclear weapons are difficult to build because they need special isotopes of uranium or plutonium as well as specialized technology This is why few countries have nuclear weapons When countries without nuclear weapons create their own this is commonly referred to as nuclear proliferation,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Isotopes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Getting a nuclear weapon to its target can be as hard as making one The explosive material can be placed in a bomb or artillery shell or into a missile When a nuclear device is placed on a missile it will commonly be called a nuclear missile Nuclear missiles can be carried by Fixed wing aircraft Submarine or Truck or they can be placed into underground missile silos Some Bomber like the B 29 Superfortress B 36 Peacemaker B 52 Stratofortress and B 2 Spirit have carried nuclear weapons,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Artillery 0 0 0 0 Missile 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Submarine 0 Truck 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bomber 0 0 B 0 B 0 B 0 0 B 0 0 0 0 0
They are also carried by missiles such as intercontinental ballistic missiles or submarine launched ballistic missiles Some missiles travel to the border of space and then launch a number of separate nuclear weapons back toward the ground with each weapon travelling to a different target This is called a MIRV Warhead or Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles Very large nuclear bombs have been produced but in practice a weapon with multiple warheads can produce much more damage by attacking more targets,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

His past experience made him ready to work more with sound and electricity He began his studies in 1874 with a musical telegraph in which he used an electric circuit and a magnet to make an iron reed or tongue vibrate One day it was found that a reed failed to respond to the current Mr Bell desired his assistant who was at the other end of the line to pluck the reed thinking it had stuck to the magnet His assistant Thomas Watson complied and to his surprise Bell heard the corresponding reed at his end of the line vibrate and sound the same without any electric current to power it A few experiments soon showed that his reed had been set in vibration by the changes in the magnetic field that the moving reed produced in the line This discovery led him to stop using the electric battery current His idea was that since the circuit was never broken all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into currents which in turn would reproduce the speech at a distance,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Telegraph 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Magnet 0 0 0 Iron 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Vibrations 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A scone is a kind of bread that is usually shaped into triangles and baked on a griddle or sheet The Oxford English Dictionary 2nd edition Scones are very small and are in the same group as the crumpet or muffin It is made of wheat barley or oatmeal and baking powder to make it rise The scone is shaped closely like the North American biscuit and its recipe is almost the same with it as well Sometimes scones may have raisins currants cheese or date  in them In the United States however scones include more sweet kind of fillings like berry chocolate chips or Nut  They can often be found in coffee shops and in a great variety in the British Isles It is generally thought that scones are best eaten when they are very hot and freshly baked right from the oven accompanied with melting warm butter Oxford Companion to Food Alan Davidson 1999,0 0 0 0 0 0 Bread 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Small 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Crumpet 0 Muffin 0 0 0 0 Wheat Barley 0 Oatmeal 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 North_American Biscuit 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cheese 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Berry 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Coffee 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A camera lens is the part of a camera that directs light to the Photographic film or in a digital camera to a computer chip that can sense the light Many cheap lenses are plastic but better ones are made from glass The lens makes an image by focusing the light,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Camera 0 0 0 0 0 Photographic_film 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Glass 0 0 0 0 Image 0 0 0 0
The majority of cameras only have one lens that users cannot change or take out This is called a fixed lens design More expensive cameras usually have lenses that come off so anyone can take out one lens and put in another A lens may be simple or may actually be made of several Lens ,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Temperature is how hot or cold something is Our bodies can feel the difference between something which is hot and something which is cold To measurement temperature more accurately a thermometer can be used Thermometers use a temperature scale to record how hot or cold something is The scale most often used is in degrees Celsius sometimes called centigrade In the USA degrees Fahrenheit are more often used while scientists mostly use kelvins to measure temperature because it never goes below zero,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Measurement 0 0 0 0 Thermometer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Celsius 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fahrenheit 0 0 0 0 0 Scientists 0 0 Kelvins 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
science temperature is a physical quantity which describes how quickly molecules are moving inside a material In solids and liquids the molecules are vibrating around a fixed point in the substance but in gases they are in free flight and bouncing off each other as they travel In a gas the temperature pressure and volume of the gas are closely related by a law of physics,Science 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Molecules 0 0 0 0 0 0 Solids 0 Liquids 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Gases 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pressure 0 Volume 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Temperature is not the same as heat Heat is energy which moves from one thing cooling it to another heating it Temperature is a measure of the movements of the molecules inside a thing If the thing has a high temperature it means the average speed of its molecules is fast A thing may have a high temperature but because it contains very few or light atoms it has very little heat,0 0 0 0 0 0 Heat 0 0 Energy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Molecules 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Average 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Temperature is also important in weather and climate It is related to the amount of heat energy in the air Isotherm maps are used to show how temperature is different across an area Temperature will be different during different times of day different seasons and in different places It is affected by how much heat reaches the place from the suns rays how altitude the place is above the sea level and how much heat is brought to the place by the movement of winds and ocean currents,0 0 0 0 0 Weather 0 Climate 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Air Isotherm 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Seasons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Altitude 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A market is a place where go to buy or sell things When people have Product  to sell they set up a market place There may be a special building for the market place or the market may be held in an open space where the sellers can put up a stall and then take the stall down at the end of the day,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Building 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
If a seller of a good cannot supply what customers want or ask for too high of a price other sellers may try to supply that good If other sellers enter the market for that good in competition that will tend to fulfill demand and lower prices Sellers who do not like competition may try to kill the competition This would establish a monopoly and many countries have laws to protect the free market against such practices,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Competition 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Monopoly 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

of the Sabbath in Judaism In fact the word Sabbath itself comes from the Hebrew word Shabbat Like the Jewish Sabbath the Sabbath in Christianity comes from the Genesis story of Creationism But unlike Jews most Christians have Sabbath on Sunday not Saturday They also rest but not the same way as Jews The exact way depends on the church Religious denomination,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Genesis 0 0 Creationism 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sunday 0 Saturday 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Religious_denomination
Most Christians honor the Sabbath on Sunday to remember the Resurrection of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar They say that there is an analogy between the obligation of the Christian day of worship and the Sabbath day ordinance These two rules are not literally identical though They say that this ordinance is no longer valid because God has replaced his old creation by a new one For this reason the obligation to keep the Sabbath is not the same for Christians as for Jews They say there are examples in the New Testament and in other writings surviving from the first few centuries,0 Christians 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Resurrection 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Analogy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The Seventh day Adventist Church and other churches disagree with some of these views They argue that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in paganism specifically Sol Invictus and Mithraism This is therefore an explicit rejection of the commandment to keep the seventh day holy Instead they keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God s work of creation believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed Seventh day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the 2nd century and 3rd century by most until the 4th and 5th century and a few thereafter but because of opposition to Judaism after the Jewish Roman wars the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship The history of these changes is certainly not altogether lost regardless of any belief in a suppression of the facts by a conspiracy of the pagans of the Roman Empire and the clergy of the Catholic Church,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Paganism 0 Sol_Invictus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2nd_century 0 3rd_century 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Jewish 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Roman_Empire 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Reverting is changing a Wikipedia page back to an older version of the page Because Wikipedia can be changed by anybody the MediaWiki software is designed to save every version of a page when it has been changed by someone When a new version of the page is saved the old version is kept in the page s so that anybody can see who changed the page when they did it and what changes they made to the page You can change the page back to any of the old versions in the page history such as when something has been added or removed when it should not have been,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Mediawiki 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Sometimes serious pathogens slip in because their surface is disguised as something the host cell walls can accept That is how viruses work Once inside a cell their genetic material controls the cell Infections like HIV get in this way and then attack cells which are the basis of the immune system Artificial means are often used to restore immune system function in an HIV challenged body and prevent the onset of AIDS This is one of the most complex issues in immunology as it involves every level of that system This research during the 1980s and 1990s radically changed the view of the human immune system and its functions and integration in the human body,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 HIV 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Aids 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Human_Body
Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease The earliest known mention of immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of some diseases could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Medicine 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Thucydides 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This and other observations of acquired immunity led to Louis Pasteur developing vaccination and the germ theory of disease Pasteur s theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease such as the miasma theory of disease It was not until the proofs Robert Koch published in 1891 that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease Nobelprize org accessed 8 January 2007 Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 when the yellow fever virus was discovered by Walter Reed Walter Reed Army Medical Center accessed 8 January 2007,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Louis_Pasteur 0 Vaccination 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Robert_Koch 0 0 0 0 Microorganisms 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Spam emails are usually sent to many at once trying to get them to buy a Product  or sign up for a service The people who the email did not ask to receive the email and do not want to receive it,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Service 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
One of the reasons there is so much spam emails around is that it costs very little to send millions of spam messages at once Spam messages can easily be sent sometimes even by a special computer program,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

If the person clicks on the link it tells the spammers that there is someone at the address Then the spammers put that person on a list of people who actually open spam messages Next the spammers sell that list to other spammers The same thing happens if the person sends another email back to the spammer which also tells the spammer the message has been opened,0 0 0 0 0 0 Link 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Address 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
