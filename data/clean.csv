Renoir is a work of art  Art is a creative activity that expresses imaginative or technical skill
It produces an artifact also called a work of art for others to experience
Those who do this are called artists
They hope to affect the emotions of people who experience it
Some people find art relaxing or exciting or informative
Many people disagree on how to define art
Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity
Art includes drawing painting sculpting photography performance art dance music poetry prose and theatre
Brno  Art is divided into the plastic arts where something is made and the performing arts where something is done by humans in action
The other division is between pure arts done for themselves and practical arts done for a practical purpose but with artistic content 
Plastic arts 
Fine art is expression by making something beautiful or appealing to the emotions by visual means drawing painting printmaking sculpture 
Literature poetry creative writing 
Performing arts 
Performing art including drama are expression using the body dance acting singing 
Auditory art expression by making sounds music singing 
Practical arts 
Culinary art expression by making flavors and tastes cooking  
The practical arts expression by making things and structures architecture filming fashion photography video games   Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind spirit and soul
An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people the number of people who can relate to it and how much they appreciate it
Some people also get inspired
The first and broadest sense of art means arrangement or to arrange
 In this sense art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design
Art may express emotion
Artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them
Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience
However if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well then the art work may become publicly successful
There are sculptures cave painting and rock art dating from the Upper Paleolithic era
All of the great ancient civilizations such as Ancient Egypt India China Greece Rome and Persia had works and styles of art
In the Middle Ages most of the art in Europe showed people from the Bible in paintings stained glass windows and mosaic tile floors and walls
Islamic art includes geometric patterns Islamic calligraphy and architecture
In India and Tibet painted sculptures dance and religious painting were done
In China arts included jade carving bronze pottery poetry calligraphy music painting drama and fiction
There are many Chinese artistic styles which are usually named after the ruling dynasty
In Europe after the Middle Ages there was a Renaissance which means rebirth
People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects
People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures but they also now could paint mythological pictures too
These artists also invented perspective where things in the distance look smaller in the picture
This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other
In the late 1800s artists in Europe responding to Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism Romanticism Realism and Impressionism
The history of twentieth century art includes Expressionism Fauvism Cubism Dadaism Surrealism and Minimalism
In some societies people think that art belongs to the person who made it
They think that the artist put his or her talent and industry into the art
In this view the art is the property of the artist protected by copyright
In other societies people think that art belongs to no one
They think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artists work
In this view society is a collective that has made the art through the artist

Spain is divided in 17 parts called autonomous communities
Autonomous means that each of these autonomous communities has its own executive  legislative judicial powers
These are similar to but not the same as states in the United States of America for example
Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces
In 1978 these parts came together making the autonomous communities
Before then some of these provinces were together but were broken
The groups that were together once before are called historic communities Catalonia Basque Country Galicia and Andalusia
The Spanish language is the sole official language in every autonomous community but six where Spanish is coofficial with other languages as follows 
Catalonia Catalan and Occitan 
Valencian Community Catalan also called Valencian there

statue of Alan Turin   Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS London 23 June 1912  Wilmslow Cheshire 7 June 1954 was an English mathematician and computer scientist
He was born in Maida Vale London
Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale London
His father was part of a family of merchants from Scotland
His mother Ethel Sara was the daughter of an engineer
Turing went to St
Michaels a school at 20 Charles Road St Leonardsonsea when he was five years old
Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers
He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do
He created the Turing machine in 1936
The machine was imaginary but it included the idea of a computer program
Turing was interested in artificial intelligence
He proposed the Turing test to say when a machine could be called intelligent
A computer could be said to think if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine
During World War II Turing worked to break German ciphers secret messages
Using cryptanalysis he helped to break the codes of the Enigma machine
After that he solved other German codes
From 1945 to 1947 Turing worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory
He presented a paper on 19 February 1946
That paper was the first detailed design of a storedprogram computer
Although it was possible to build ACE there were delays in starting the project
In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year
While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was built without him
It ran its first program on 10May 1950
Turing was a homosexual man
In 1952 he admitted having had sex with a man in England
At that time homosexual acts were illegal
Turing was convicted
He had to choose between going to jail and taking hormones to lower his sex drive
He decided to take the hormones
After his punishment he became impotent
He also grew breasts
In May 2012 a private members bill was put before the House of Lords to grant Turing a statutory pardon
In July 2013 the government supported it
A royal pardon was granted on 24 December 2013
In 1954 Turing died from cyanide poisoning
The cyanide came from either an apple which was poisoned with cyanide or from water that had cyanide in it
The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide
It is also suspected that he committed suicide
The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong
It is against medical ethics and international laws of human rights
In August 2009 a petition asking the British Government to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started
The petition received thousands of signatures
Prime Minister Gordon Brown acknowledged the petition
He called Turings treatment appalling

is used to move ai  Air is the Earths atmosphere
Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles
It is the clear gas in which living things live and breathe
It has an indefinite shape and volume
It has no colour or smell
It has mass and weight because it is matter
The weight of air creates atmospheric  pressure
There is no air in outer space
Air is a mixture of about 78 nitrogen 21 oxygen 09 argon 004 carbon dioxide and very small amounts of other gases
There is an average of about 1 water vapour
Animals live by aerobic respiration and need to breathe the oxygen in the air
In breathing the lungs put oxygen into the blood and send back carbon dioxide to the air
Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live
They give off the oxygen that we breathe
Without it we die of asphyxia
Wind is moving air
This causes weather
Air can be polluted by some gases such as carbon monoxide smoke and ash
This air pollution causes various problems including smog acid rain and global warming
It can damage peoples health
Aircraft use propellers to move air over a wing which allows them to fly
Pneumatics use air pressure to move things

Arithmetic is a name for working with numbers
It is a part of mathematics
The four basic arithmetic operations are addition subtraction multiplication and division
Harder arithmetic includes working with signed numbers fractions and decimals and taking powers and roots
Most people learn arithmetic in primary school but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned
Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic
A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters plumbers auto mechanics accountants architects doctors and nurses
Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics science and engineering
A calculator can be used to do arithmetic
Computers can do it more quickly which is one reason Global Positioning System receivers have a small computer inside
235 adding is commutative 23 is the same as 32  
752 subtracting is not commutative 75 is different from 57  
3412 multiplying is commutative 34 is the same as 43  
623 dividing is not commutative 62 is different from 26      
Addition is the mathematical way of putting things together
In arithmetic addition is finding the total of two or more numbers
The sign for addition is 
The name for the sign  is plus
Another name for the total is the sum
For example there are  in two groups
The objects are small circles o
One group has five of these objects
The other group has 3 of these objects
To find the total number of objects in both groups the objects can be counted
Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group

Aquaculture is the farming of fish shrimp and algae and other seafood
Aquaculture supplies fish such as catfish salmon and trout
Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in China and aquaculture supplies over 20 of all the seafood harvested
Aquaculture is quite a new activity in Canada as it only began in 1879
Fish farming has been practiced in some parts of the world for hundreds of years
Today half of the seafood eaten in the US is farmed
To help meet the growing global demand for seafood aquaculture is growing fast
The environmental impact of fish farming varies widely depending on the species being farmed the methods used and where the farm is located
When good practices are used its possible to farm seafood in a way that has very little impact to the environment
Such operations limit habitat damage disease escapes of farmed fish and the use of wild fish as feed
An abbreviation is a shorter way to write a word or phrase
People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot
The English language occasionally uses the apostrophe mark  to show that a word is written in a shorter way but some abbreviations do not use this mark
More often they use periods especially the ones that come from the Latin language
Common Latin abbreviations include ie
that is eg
for example and et al
and others
Some new abbreviations have been created by scientists by workers in companies and governments and by people using the Internet
People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are acronyms
Here are examples of common acronyms The word radar is an acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging
The name of the large computer company IBM comes from the words International Business Machines
The name of the part of the United States government that sends rockets into outer space is NASA from the words National Aeronautics and Space Administration
When people using the Internet think that something is very funny they sometimes write LOL to mean Laughing Out Loud
People sometimes write ASAP for As Soon As Possible

Ad hominem is a Latin word for a type of argument
It is a word often used in rhetoric
Rhetoric is the science of speaking well and convincing other people of your ideas
Translated to English ad hominem means against the person
In other words when someone makes an ad hominem they are attacking the person they are arguing against instead of what they are saying
The term comes from the Latin word homo which means human
Hominem is a gender neutral version of the word homo
In ancient Rome it referred to all free men or in other words all free human beings
Ad hominem can be a way to use reputation rumors and hearsay to change the minds of other people listening
When a social network has already excluded or exiled one person or applied a negative label to them this can work more often
It is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument
In courts and in diplomacy ad hominems are not appreciated
Ad hominems are not wrong every time
For example when people think that someone cant be trusted things that they have said previously can be doubted
In logic a  is something that starts with premises and goes through a few logical arguments to reach a conclusion
 All humans are mortal  Socrates is a man he is human  Therefore Socrates is mortal
 Person A thinks abortion should be illegal  Person A is uneducated and poor  Therefore abortion should not be illegal
In this example it can be seen that the completely unrelated fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal
Fallacy for a list of other types of false rhetorical arguments
American English or United States English is the dialect of the English language spoken in the United States of America
It is different in some ways from other types of English such as British English
Many types of American English came from local dialects in England
Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another sort of English is spoken
This may be because people hear and read American English through the media for example movies television and the Internet where the most common form of English is American English
Because people all over the world use the English language it gets many new words
English has been changing in this way for hundreds of years
For example the many millions who speak Indian English frequently add American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words from the various Indian languages
Sometimes people learn American English as it is spoken in America
For example in telephone call centers in India and other places people often learn American English to sound more like their customers who call from America
These people often keep using American English in everyday life
The meaning of many words are different in American English
Most changes in a language start with small things
For example Italian Spanish and French all came from Latin
There are many words that sound the same in both American English and British English but are spelled differently
For example  
Words originally from French that end in our in British English behaviour colour honour neighbour etc end in or in American English behavior color honor neighbor
Words that come from French that end in re in British English metre centre end in er in American English
In these cases Canadian English usage is to keep the British and French spelling 
Verbs that end in ise in British English criticise realise end in ize in American English criticize organize realize
However the ize ending is optional in British English and is shown as an option in British dictionaries 
One of the changes introduced by Noah Webster is the change of the double l from words like travelled to traveled
Books show that many of these differences come from the writings of Englishlover Noah Webster who made the American dictionary following the American War of Independence
Some more differences in American English 
aluminium is spelled aluminum 
doughnut is sometimes spelled donut 
draught is spelled draft 
gaol not common is spelled jail 
plough is spelled plow   There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English eg 
aeroplane is called airplane 
ladybird is called ladybug 
lift is called elevator 
toilet is called bathroom restroom or comfort station 
lorry is called truck 
nappies are called diapers 
petrol is called gas or gasoline 
the boot of a car is called a trunk 
a dummy is called a pacifier 
trousers are called pants 
underground is called subway 
football is called soccer 
braces are suspenders suspenders in BritishEnglish are a type of clothing worn around the lower leg by males to stop sockssox from sagging and around the upper leg by women wearing stockings   General American English is the kind most spoken in mass media
It more vigorously pronounces the letter R than some other kinds do Rdropping is frequent in certain places where r sound is not pronounced after a vowel
For example as in the words car and card sounding like cah and cahd
This occurs in the Boston area
Native Americans also called Aboriginal Americans American Indians Amerindians or Indigenous Peoples of America are the people and their descendants who were in North America Central America South America and the Caribbean Islands when Europeans arrived
There are many different tribes of Native American people with many different languages
There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the US combined
About 51 million Native Americans live in Latin America
Sometimes these people are called Indians but this is confusing because it is the same word used for people from India
When Christopher Columbus was travelling West he did not know about the Americas
He thought he was going to West Indies so he called the people Indians
Many Native Americans died after the Europeans came to the Americas from diseases that came with the Europeans that were new to the Native Americans in battle with the Europeans or because the Europeans made them work as slaves
Most of the native people were hurt or killed by settlers who took their lands
The ancestors of Native Americans came to the Americas from Asia
Some of them may have come to America over 12000 years ago when Alaska was connected to Siberia by the Bering land bridge
Some Native American tribes of North America are Cherokee Iroquois Maya or Yucatec Aztecs Navajo and Sioux
Some Native American tribes of South America are Aymara Guarani Quechua and Tupi

Ancient EgyptFlax  Farming is growing crops or keeping animals by people for food and raw materials
Farming is a part of agriculture
Agriculture started thousands of years ago but no one knows for sure how old it is
The development of farming gave rise to the Neolithic Revolution whereby people gave up nomadic hunting and became settlers in what became cities
Agriculture and domestication probably started in the Fertile Crescent the Nile Valley The Levant and Mesopotamia
The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of Iraq Syria Turkey Jordan Lebanon Israel and Egypt
Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew
People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops but still gathered many foods from the wild
People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change
Farming can feed many more people than huntergatherers can feed on the same amount of land
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals but also growing other things like flowers and nursery plants manure or dung animal hides skins or furs leather animals fungi fibers cotton wool hemp and flax biofuels  and drugs biopharmaceuticals marijuana opium
Many people still live by subsistence agriculture on a small farm
They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer his family and his animals
The yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land and it is often low
This is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated and they have less money to buy equipment
Drought and other problems sometimes cause famines
Where yields are low deforestation can provide new land to grow more food
This provides more nutrition for the farmers family but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years
In rich countries farms are often fewer and larger
During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants use more fertilizer use more water and more easily control weeds and pests
Many farms also use machines so fewer people can farm more land
There are fewer farmers in rich countries but the farmers are able to grow more
This kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems
Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers pesticides chemicals that kill bugs and herbicides chemicals that kill weeds
These chemicals can pollute the soil or the water
They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals causing outbreaks of these pests
The soil can be damaged by erosion blowing or washing away salt buildup or loss of structure
Irrigation adding water from rivers can pollute water and lower the water table
These problems have all got solutions and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education
Fertilizers 
Crop rotation 
Weed removal 
Breeding 
Fencing 
Ranching 
Plantation  Farmers select plants with better yield taste and nutritional value
They also choose plants that can survive plant disease and drought and are easier to harvest
Centuries of artificial selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants
The crops produce better yield with other techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control irrigation
Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries and genetically modify these plants to improve them
They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries
New plants were created with genetic engineering
One example of genetic engineering is modifying a plant to resist a herbicide
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone
The food must also be safe and good
People say it is not always safe because it contains some chemicals
Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment
For this reason there are several types of agriculture 
Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries 
Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money
It uses pesticides machinery chemical fertilizers
Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure
Integrated farming is using local resources and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process
Agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production
Common goals of policy include the quality amount and safety of food
There are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today
These include 
Erosion 
Diseases 
Pests 
Weeds 
Drought 
Rainfall   The major crops produced in the world in 2002 are maize corn wheat rice and cotton
Maize 624 millions of metric tons 
Wheat 570 millions of metric tons 
Rice 3811 millions of metric tons 
Cotton 965 millions of metric tons  See also List of vegetables List of herbs List of fruit

August Aug is the 8th month of the year in the Gregorian calendar coming between July and September
It has 31 days the same number of days as the previous month July and is named after Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar
August doesnt begin on the same day of the week as any other month in common years but begins on the same day of the week as February in leap years
August always ends on the same day of the week as November
Augustus Caesar after whom August is name This month was first called Sextilis in Latin because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar
The Roman calendar began in March about 735BC with Romulus
October was the eighth month
August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700BC
Or when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450BC Roman writers disagree
In 153 BC January 1 was determined as the beginning of the year
August is named for Augustus Caesar who became Roman consul in this month
The month has 31 days because Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 45 BC
August is after July and before September
August in either hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of February in the other
In the Northern hemisphere it is a summer month and it is a winter month in the Southern hemisphere
No other month in common years begins on the same day of the week as August but August begins on the same day of the week as February in leap years
August ends on the same day of the week as November every year as each others last days are 13 weeks 91 days apart
In common years August starts on the same day of the week as March and November of the previous year and in leap years June of the previous year
In common years August finishes on the same day of the week as March and June of the previous year and in leap years September of the previous year
In common years immediately after other common years August starts on the same day of the week as February of the previous year
In years immediately before common years August starts on the same day of the week as May of the following year and in years immediately before leap years October of the following year
In years immediately before common years August finishes on the same day of the week as May of the following year and in years immediately before leap years February and October of the following year

Anatomy is the study of the bodies of people and other animals
Anatomy is the study of the inside of the body and outside the body
Anatomy notes the position and structure of organs such as muscles glands and bones
A person who studies anatomy is an anatomist
The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BC when Egyptians began studying human anatomy
They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver spleen kidneys heart etc and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system
For long periods the dissection of deceased people was forbidden and correct ideas about human anatomy was a long time coming
Academic human anatomists are usually employed by universities medical schools and teaching hospitals
They are often involved in teaching and research
Gross anatomy studies parts of the body that are big enough to see
Microanatomy studies smaller parts
There are different organ systems such as the cardiovascular system also known as the circulatory system the system that gets blood around the body the muscular system the system that contains muscles the nervous system the system that controls the nervesand the brain and the skeleton the bones
Anatomy physiology and biochemistry are similar basic medical sciences

NEAR An asteroid is a space rock
It is small object in the Solar System that travels around the Sun
It is like a planet but smaller
They range from very small smaller than a car to 600 miles 1000 km across
A few asteroids have asteroid moons
The name asteroid means like a star in the ancient Greek language
Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky but they really do move around the Sun while stars only seem to move because the Earth spins
Like planets asteroids do not make their own light
Because of this some people think asteroids is not a good name and think that the name planetoid like a planet would be a better name
Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid in 1801
It was named 1 Ceres and is the biggest object in the asteroid belt
Other asteroids in the asteroid belt like 3 Juno 2 Pallas and 4 Vesta were found later
Today astronomers using computerized telescopes find thousands of asteroids every month
Asteroid impact prediction is one of the purposes
Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the Solar System
These rocks were too small to come together to make a planet
Some are made of carbon or metal
Depending on whats on the surface they are classified into various asteroid spectral types including Type M metal Type S stone and Type C carbon
Most asteroids in our Solar System are in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter
Many are not in the main asteroid belt
The ones that come close to Earth are called NearEarth asteroids
Many scientists think asteroids striking the Earth killed off all the dinosaurs and caused some of the other extinction events
Colombia Greece uses columns all made in ston  Architecture is the art and science of the design of structures or buildings such as houses places of worship and office buildings
Architecture is also the profession of an architect
Usually a person must  at an institution of higher education university to become an architect
In ancient times there were architects long before there was higher education
Architecture can be about small designs such as a garage or large designs such as a whole city
Architecture often overlaps with civil engineering and architects and civil engineers often work together
In the past people built s and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather
For safety they were often close together
Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures like the Great Pyramids of Giza
The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call Classical Architecture
The Romans working over 2000 years ago copied the arch from the Etruscans who copied it from the Mesopotamians
The stone columns which still hold up so many important buildings like the Parthenon in Athens were simply copied from the first wooden posts
Hungary Classical Architecture was very formal and it always obeyed laws
It used symmetry which really means  and it used proportion which means keeping shapes in certain ways
The Golden Mean was a rule or law which said to put it very simply if you are making a room or any other thing it will work best if you always make the long side 16 times longer than the short side
There are many laws in Classical Architecture like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be
These laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago
In some parts of the world like India the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces
Different architectural styles were made in China Japan Southeast Asia Africa Mexico and Central and South America
Later people in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture then Gothic architecture
Gothic buildings have tall pointed windows and arches
Many churches have Gothic architecture
Castles were also built at this time
In Eastern Europe churches usually had domes
People added their own ideas and decoration to the Classical Architecture of the past
The Renaissance brought a return to classical ideas
Guggenheim Museum in New York City In the late 18th century with the Industrial Revolution people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply
Many factories and mills were built during or after this revolution
Decades later in the Victorian era architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style to build new churches
Up to this point buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them
Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller
For example the cathedral in Ulm Germany is over 500 feet tall
However building with stone has its limits and building too tall could result in collapse
This happened to the Beauvais Cathedral which was never completed
Willis Tower in Chicago  Towards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution steel became much cheaper
Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build
An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Buildings can now be built taller than ever before
We call them skyscrapers
This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated replaced or abandoned
Cheap strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls especially for office buildings
Modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890
Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then which are sometimes called postmodern
Many of the worlds greatest structures were built by modernday architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright I M Pei Adrian Smith Edward Durell Stone Frank Gehry Fazlur Khan Gottfried Bhm and Bruce Graham

The apple tree Malus domestica is a tree that grows fruit such as apples in the rose family best known for its juicy tasty fruit
It is grown worldwide as a fruit tree
It is considered to be a worldwide lowcost fruit harvestable all over the world
The tree originated in Central Asia
Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe
They were brought to North America by European settlers
Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures
Apples are generally propagated by grafting although wild apples grow readily from seed
Apple trees are large if grown from seed but small if grafted onto roots rootstock
There are more than 7500 known cultivars of apples with a range of desired characteristics
Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses cooking eating raw and cider production are the most common uses
Trees and fruit are attacked by fungi bacteria and pests
In 2010 the fruits genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production
Worldwide production of apples in 2013 was 908 million tonnes
China grew 49 of the total
The apple has a small leafshedding tree that grows up to  tall
The apple tree has a broad crown with thick twigs
The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals
They are 5 to 12 centimetres long and 36centimetres 1224in wide
It has a sharp top with a soft underside
Blossoms come out in spring at the same time that the leaves begin to bud
The flowers are white
They also have a slightly pink color
They are five petaled and 25 to 35 centimetres 098 to 14 in in 
The fruit  in autumn
It is usually 5 to 9 centimetres 20 to 35 in in diameter
There are five carpels arranged in a star in the middle of the fruit
Every carpel has one to three seeds
Kazakhstan   The wild ancestor of apple trees is Malus sieversii
They grow wild in the mountains of Central Asia in the north of Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan and Xinjiang China They are being used recently to develop Malus domestica to grow in colder 
Apples were brought to North America in the 1600s
The first apple orchard on the North American continent was said to be near Boston in 1625
In the 1900s costly fruit industries where the apple was a very important species began developing
Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates
One large collection of over 2100 apple cultivars is at the National Fruit Collection in England
Most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh dessert apples
However some are grown simply for cooking or making cider
Cider apples are usually too  to eat immediately
However they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot
Most popular apple cultivars are soft but 
Colorful skin easy shipping disease resistance Red Delicious apple shape and popular flavor are also needed
Modern apples are usually sweeter than older cultivars
This is because popular tastes in apples have become different
Most North Americans and Europeans enjoy sweet apples
and India

Algebra is a part of mathematics often called math in the United States and maths or numeracy in the United Kingdom 
It uses variables to represent a value that is not yet known
When an equals sign  is used this is called an equation
A very simple equation using a variable is    In this example  or it could also be said x equals five
This is called solving for x
Besides equations there are inequalities less than and greater than
A special type of equation is called the function
This is often used in making graphs because it always turns one input into one output
Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things
Physics engineering and computer programming are areas that use algebra all the time
It is also useful to know in surveying construction and business especially accounting
People who do algebra use the rules of numbers and mathematic operations used on numbers
The simplest are adding subtracting multiplying and dividing
More advanced operations involve exponents starting with squares and square roots
Algebra was first used to solve equations and inequalities
Two examples are linear equations the equation of a straight line  and quadratic equations which has variables that are squared multiplied by itself for example 
Early forms of algebra were developed by the Babylonians and the Greeks
However the word algebra is a Latin form of the Arabic word AlJabr casting and comes from a mathematics book AlMaqala fi Hisabal Jabr waalMuqabilah Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation written in the 9th century by a Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Ms alKhwrizm who was a Muslim born in Khwarizm in Uzbekistan
He flourished under AlMamoun in Baghdad Iraq through 813833 AD and died around 840 AD
The book was brought into Europe and translated into Latin in the 12th century
The book was then given the name Algebra The ending of the mathematicians name alKhwarizmi was changed into a word easier to say in Latin and became the English word algorithm
Here is a simple example of an algebra problem  
Sue has 12 candies Ann has 24  
candies
They decide to share so that they have the same number of candies
These are the steps you can use to solve the problem   To have the same number of candies Ann has to give some to Sue
Let x represent the number of candies Ann gives to Sue
 Sues candies plus x must be the same as Anns candies minus x
This is written as    Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation
This gives 
What happens on one side of the equals sign must happen on the other side too for the equation to still be true
So in this case when 12 was subtracted from both sides there was a middle step of 
After a person is comfortable with this the middle step is not written down  Add x to both sides of the equation
This gives   Divide both sides of the equation by 2
This gives 
The answer is six
If Ann gives Sue 6 candies they will have the same number of candies  To check this put 6 back into the original equation wherever x was   This gives  which is true
They both now have 18 candies
With practice algebra can be used when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way
Problems such as building a freeway designing a cell phone or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra
As in most parts of mathematics adding z to y or y plus z is written as 
Subtracting z from y or y minus z is written as 
Dividing y by z or y over z  is written as  or 
is more commonly used
In algebra multiplying y by z or y times z can be written in 4 ways    or just 
The multiplication symbol  is usually not used because it looks too much like the letter x which is often used as a variable
Also when multiplying a larger expression parentheses can be used 
When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra we write the number in front of the letter 
When the number is 1 then the 1 is not written because 1 times any number is that number 1  y  y and so it is not needed
As a side note you do not have to use the letters x or y in algebra
Variables are just symbols that mean some unknown number or value so you can use any variable x and y are the most common though
An important part of algebra is the study of functions since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve
A function is like a machine you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number or numbers out
When using functions graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations
A graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true
Usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables
The graph is often a line and if the line does not bend or go straight upanddown it can be described by the basic formula 
The variable b is the yintercept of the graph where the line crosses the vertical axis and m is the slope or steepness of the line
This formula applies to the coordinates of a graph where each point on the line is written 
In some math problems like the equation for a line there can be more than one variable x and y in this case
To find points on the line one variable is changed
The variable that is changed is called the independent variable
Then the math is done to make a number
The number that is made is called the dependent variable
Most of the time the independent variable is written as x and the dependent variable is written as y for example in 
This is often put on a graph using an x axis going left and right and a y axis going up and down
It can also be written in function form 
So in this example we could put in 5 for x and get 
Put in 2 for x would get 
And 0 for x would get 
So there would be a line going thru the points 516 27 and 01 as seen in the graph to the right
If x has a power of 1 it is a straight line
If it is squared or some other power it will be curved
If it uses an inequality  is   Reciprocal  the reciprocal of  is

commonname                                                Angola officially called the Republic of Angola is a country in Africa
The capital is Luanda
Angola is in the south of the continent
Angola is a member state of the African Union the Community of Portuguese Language Countries the Latin Union South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone and the Southern African Development Community
Portugal built up its power in Angola from the late 15th to the middle 20th century
After independence there was a civil war from 1975 to 2002
Cuba and the Soviet Bloc supported the ruling Peoples Movement for the Liberation of Angola MPLA
South Africa supported the insurgent anticommunist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola UNITA
The war ended after the rebel leader was killed
Angola is the worlds twentythird largest country
Angola is bordered by Namibia to the south Zambia to the east the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the northeast and the South Atlantic Ocean to the west
Angolas average temperature on the coast is  in the winter and  in the summer
It has two seasons dry May to October and hot rainy November to April
Angolas population is estimated to be 18498000 2009
Angola is divided into eighteen provinces
Astronomy is a natural science
It is the study of everything outside the atmosphere of Earth
It studies celestial objects such as stars galaxies planets moons  asteroids comets and nebulae and processes such as supernovae explosions gamma ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation
This includes the physics chemistry of those objects and processes
The word astronomy comes from the Greek words astron which means star and nomos which means law
A person who studies astronomy is called an astronomer
Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences
Ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate and to find when was the best time to plant crops
Astronomy is very similar to astrophysics
A related subject physical cosmology is concerned with studying the Universe as a whole and the way the universe changed over time
Astronomy is not the same as astrology the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets may affect human lives
Since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy observational and theoretical astronomy
Observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to  or look at stars galaxies and other astronomical objects
Theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to predict what should happen
The two often work together the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars
They made maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and calendars to work out the time of year
Early civilisations such as the Maya people and the Ancient Egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions
They also began to think about the place of Earth in the universe
For a long time people thought Earth was the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun went around it
This is known as geocentrism
Ancient Greeks tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements
A mathematician named Eratosthenes was the first who measured the size of the Earth and proved that the Earth is a sphere
A theory by another mathematician named Aristarchus was that the sun is in the center and the Earth is moving around it
This is known as heliocentrism
Only a few people thought it was right
The rest continued to believe in the geocentric model
Most of the names of constellations and stars come from Greeks of that time
Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the Middle Ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth
They also learned from the ancients by translating Greek books into Arabic
the Moon by Galileo
His drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used a telescope to look at the Moon During the renaissance a priest named Nicolaus Copernicus thought from looking at the way the planets moved that the Earth was not the center of everything
Based on previous works he said that the Earth was a planet and all the planets moved around the sun
This brought back the old idea of heliocentrism
A physicist called Galileo Galilei built his own telescopes and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time
He agreed with Copernicus
The Catholic Church decided that Galileo was wrong
He had to spend the rest of his life under house arrest
Heliocentric ideas were soon improved by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton who invented the theory of gravity
After Galileo people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets Uranus and Neptune
They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun but in a range of colours and sizes
They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae
The 20th century saw important changes in astronomy
In 1931 Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky
Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy allowing more discoveries to be made
The opening of this new window on the Universe saw the discovery of entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space
The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source
The period after World War 2 saw more observatories where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites normally by governments
For example Bernard Lovell began radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank using leftover military radar equipment
By 1957 the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world
Similarly the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at Mauna Kea in Hawaii a good site for visible and infrared telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies
The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry
This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites
Space telescopes gave access for the first time in history to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere
The Xrays gamma rays ultraviolet light and parts of the infrared spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched
As with other parts of the spectrum new discoveries were made
From 1970s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum
Discoveries broadly come in two types  bodies and phenomena
Bodies are things in the Universe whether it is a planet like our Earth or a galaxy like our Milky Way
Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe
For convenience this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found those found around stars are solar bodies those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies

Austria  officially called Republic of Austria is a country in Central Europe
Around Austria there are the countries of Germany Czech Republic Slovakia Hungary Slovenia Italy Switzerland and Liechtenstein
Currently the chancellor is Sebastian Kurz
The previous chancellor was Christian Kern 2016  2017
Austria has been a memberstate of the European Union since 1995
The people in Austria speak German a few also speak Hungarian Slovenian and Croatian
The capital of Austria is Vienna Wien
Austria is more than a thousand years old
Its history can be followed to the ninth century
At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria
The name Ostarrichi is first written in an official document from 996
Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word sterreich which literally means East Empire   Austria is a democratic republic
It is a neutral state that means it does not take part in wars with other countries
It has been in the United Nations since 1955 and in the European Union since 1995
Austria is also a federal state and divided into nine states    Burgenland Burgenland  Carinthia Krnten  Lower Austria Niedersterreich  Salzburgerland Salzburg  Styria Steiermark  Tyrol Tirol  Upper Austria Obersterreich  Vienna Wien  Vorarlberg Vorarlberg  More information States of Austria
The federal government has been consisting of the VP and the FP parties since December 18 2017
Chancellor is Sebastian Kurz VP
There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time
The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age
That was the time of the Neanderthals
They left works of art such as the Venus of Willendorf
In the Neolithic age people were living there to dig for mineral resources especially copper
tzi a mummy found in a glacier between Austria and Italy is from that time
In the Bronze Age people built bigger settlements and fortresses especially where there were mineral resources
Salt mining began near Hallstatt
At that time Celts began to form the first states

Acceleration is a measure of how fast velocity 
Acceleration is the change of velocity divided by the change of time
Acceleration is a vector and therefore includes both a size and a direction
An object was moving north at 10 meters per second
The object speeds up and now is moving north at 15 meters per second
The object has accelerated
An apple is falling down
It starts falling at 0 meters per second
At the end of the first second the apple is moving at 98 meters per second
The apple has accelerated
At the end of the second second the apple is moving down at 196 meters per second
The apple has accelerated again 
Jane is walking east at 3 kilometers per hour
Janes velocity does not change
Janes acceleration is zero
Tom was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour
Tom turns and walks south at 3 kilometers per hour
Tom has had a nonzero acceleration
Sally was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour
Sally slows down
After Sally walks east at 15 kilometers per hour
Sally has had a nonzero acceleration 
Acceleration due to gravity    Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object
Acceleration  can be found by using  where  is the velocity at the start  is the velocity at the end  is the time at the start   is the time at the end   Sometimes the change in velocity  is written as 
Sometimes the change in time  is written as t
In difficult situations the acceleration can be calculated using mathematics in calculus acceleration is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time 
Acceleration has its own units of measurement
For example if velocity is measured in meters per second and if time is measured in seconds then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared  ms
Acceleration can be positive or negative
When the acceleration is negative but the velocity does not change direction it is sometimes called deceleration
For example when a car brakes it decelerates
Physicists usually only use the word acceleration
Newtons laws of motion are rules for how things move
These rules are called laws of motion
Isaac Newton is the scientist who first wrote down the main laws of motion
According to Newtons Second Law of Motion the force something needs to accelerate an object depends on the objects mass the amount of stuff the object is made from or how heavy it is
The formula of Newtons Second Law of Motion is  where  is the acceleration  is the force and  the mass
This formula is very wellknown and it is very important in physics
Newtons Second Law of Motion in short Newtons Second Law is often one of the first things that physics students learn
Deceleration is the opposite of acceleration
This means that something slows down instead of speeding up
For example when a car brakes it is decelerating
Roman theatre in Alexandria Egypt  Archaeology or archeology is the study of the past by looking for the remains and objects left by the people who lived long ago
These remains can include old coins tools buildings and inscriptions
Archaeologists the people who study archaeology use these remains to understand how people lived
When archaeologists do fieldwork they look for remains often by digging in the ground
As settlements places where people lived in groups change and grow old buildings get buried
Usually this is a natural process
A typical student project is to leave an object in a place where there is nothing going on
It will get covered rather quickly because wind water and plants will bury it
Sometimes buildings are deliberately buried to make way for new buildings
Ancient Rome for example is now up to 40feet 12metres below the present city
This process of natural or manmade burial is why archaeological fieldwork involves digging and is expensive and takes a long time
When things are found or even when nothing is found the results of the fieldwork are taken back to a base
Short term the base is often on or near the site
Longer term the results will usually go to a university or museum
Everything is written down on paper or entered into a computer
Gradually they build up a picture of what happened long ago
Archaeologists publish their research so others can understand what they learned
Archaeologists do not all study the same topics
They have specialties
Some fields of interest include Ancient Egypt these specialists are called Egyptologists Ancient China or the Vikings
Archaeologists study every civilization that is known especially the ones where there is no written history
They can study any time period
For example one might study the beginning of human life in Africa or study World War II
Marine archaeologists study things that are now underwater
They search for sunken ships or cities that have been lost under the sea
There are many different ways of doing archaeology these depend on the methods used the things studied and the environment
Some of these subdisciplines overlap with each other
Archaeology relating to oceans seas and lakes is usually done underwater
It includes the study of sunken ships and submerged coastlines Maritime archaeology is a part of this subdivision
It refers to the archaeological investigation of past ships and seafaring
A famous example of maritime archaeology is the recovery and restoration of the ship burial at Sutton Hoo
When a glacier melts objects that were captured in it are revealed
The recovery and study of these objects is called icepatch archaeology
A famous example is tzi the Iceman
Historical archaeology deals with places things and issues from the past or present at or related to sites with written records or oral traditions
Or it can be defined as the archaeological investigation of any past culture that has developed a literate tradition
 A prominent example of historical archaeology is the work done at Colonial Williamsburg
This relatively new branch of archaeology consists of the systematic study of structures and artefacts as a means of enlarging our understanding of the industrial past
   Archaeozoology or zooarchaeology is the study of the relationships between humans and animals in the archaeological record
This includes the study of bones feathers teeth and other body parts as well as their interpretation
This field involves attempts at replicating the actions and conditions of ancient cultures
Good examples are Butser Ancient Farm and Overton Down
In many countries governments and other groups of people protect important archaeological sites so they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them
Sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new buildings
Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens because people who are building often dont have a lot of time
As soon as the archaeologists are done with their work the remains that they have found will be covered over unless they are very important

Argentina officially the Argentine Republic  is a country in South America
Argentina is the secondlargest country in South America and the eighthlargest country in the world
Spanish is the language most people speak and the official language but many other languages are spoken
There are minorities speaking Italian German English Quechua and even Welsh in Patagonia
The capital city of the Argentina is Buenos Aires one of the largest cities in the world in eastern Argentina
In order by number of people the largest cities in Argentina are Buenos Aires Crdoba Rosario Mendoza La Plata Tucumn Mar del Plata Salta Santa Fe and Baha Blanca
Argentina is between the Andes mountain range in the west and the southern Atlantic Ocean in the east and south
It is bordered by Paraguay and Bolivia in the north Brazil and Uruguay in the northeast and Chile in the west and south
It also claims the Falkland Islands Spanish Islas Malvinas and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands
Most citizens of the Argentine Republic are descendants of immigrants from Europe
They are united by citizenship and not necessarily by ethnicity
Most Argentinians embrace both their ethnic origins and Argentinian nationality
The name Argentina comes from the Latin argentum silver as the Spanish conquistadors believed the area had silver
In the Americas South and North Canada US Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries in that order
The oldest signs of people in Argentina are in the Patagonia Piedra Museo Santa Cruz and are more than 13000 years old
In 1480 the Inca Empire conquered northwestern Argentina making it part of the empire
In the northeastern area the Guaran developed a culture based on yuca and sweet potato however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta red wines Italian influence and beef
Other languages spoken are Italian English and German
Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian
Argentineans are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent
Argentina declared independent from Spain in 1816 and achieved it in a War led by Jos de San Martn in 1818
Many immigrants from Europe came to the country
By the 1920s it was the 7th wealthiest country in the world but it began a decline after this
In the 1940s following the infamous decade where the countrys politics were not stable Juan Peron came to power
Peron was one of the most important people in the countrys history and many politicians today call themselves Peronist
Peron was forced out of power in 1955
After spending years in exile he returned to power in the 1970s
In 1976 the country was falling into chaos and the military took power
This was not the first time the military had done this
Leading the new government was Jorge Rafael Videla
Videla was one of historys most brutal dictators
Thousands of people disappeared or were killed during his time as president
Videla retired in 1980
One of his successors was another general turned dictator Leopoldo Galtieri
By the time Galtieri was in office in 1981 the dictatorship became unpopular
To try to stir up support Galtieri ordered an invasion of the Falkland Islands starting the Falklands War
Argentina lost the war and soon the country fell into chaos again
Galtieri was removed from power and eventually democracy was restored
Galtieri and Videla would be charged with crimes against humanity because of the mass murder and other crimes that they ordered as president
Today Argentina is one of the most important countries in Latin America though it still has many problems facing it
It has a large economy and is an influential country in the southern cone of South America
Argentina is a federal republic
The people of Argentina vote for a President to rule them and Senators and Deputies to speak for them and make laws for them
The President is Mauricio Macri since December 2015
Argentina is divided into 23 provinces provincias singular provincia and 1 city commonly known as capital federal

April is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumnfall month in the Southern Hemisphere
In each hemisphere it is the seasonal equivalent of October in the other
It is unclear as to where April got its name
A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word aperire meaning to open referring to flowers opening in spring
Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite the Greek goddess of love
It was originally the second month in the old Roman Calendar before the start of the new year was put to January 1
Quite a few festivals are held in this month
In many Southeast Asian cultures new year is celebrated in this month including Songkran
In Western Christianity Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25
In Orthodox Christianity it can fall between April 4 and May 8
At the end of the month Central and Northern European cultures celebrate Walpurgis Night on April 30 marking the transition from winter into summer
Poets use April to mean the end of winter
For example April showers bring May flowers

Black pudding is an English name for blood sausage
It is food made by cooking down the blood of any mammal usually pigs or cattle with meat fat or filler until it is thick enough to congeal become firm or solid when cooled
In Great Britain blood sausage is called  Black Pudding
The ingredients include pigs blood suet bread barley and oatmeal
The most common kind of German blutwurst is made from fatty pork meat beef blood and filler such as barley
Though already cooked and ready to eat it is usually served warm
Other kinds of blood sausage include boudin noir France boudin rouge Creole and Cajun and morcilla Spain
A legend says that blood sausage was invented in a bet between two Bavarian butchers drunk on the alcoholic drink absinthe during the 14th century
Homers Odyssey from Ancient Greece says that As when a man besides a great fire has filled a sausage with fat and blood and turns it this way and that and is very eager to get it quickly roasted

A boot device is used to start a computer
It is named after a boot which fits on the foot
The word bootstrap is also closely related and means to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better
It comes from the English phrase pull yourself up by your own bootstraps
  Before a computer can operate normally it must have operating system instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions
A boot device loads the operating system into the memory of the computer
Devices that can boot a computer are usually boot disks or boot drives normally a hard drive but can be a floppy disk or a CD
Some network computers use boot chips that get the operating system over a network
Web phones also use such chips to identify the user to the mobile phone network
Boot card standards may let many users boot kiosk computers with full privacy and access to all application software they own
There are also boot boards or boot addin cards that are more permanent than boot cards
Some people refer to the boot device as just a boot and nonboot devices as data devices although it is not the computer but the operating system that cares about the difference between these
The boot in boot device is the same as booting or starting up
This is short for bootstrapping or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it

and                               various people live in Australia and about 80 of them live on the east coast
The country is divided up into six states and two territories and more than half of Australias population lives in and around the cities of Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth and Adelaide
Australia is known for its mining its production of wool and as the worlds largest producer of bauxite
Its emblem is a flower called the Golden Wattle
Australias landmass of 7617930 square kilometers is on the IndoAustralian plate
The continent of Australia including the island of Tasmania was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago
Because of this many animals and plants live in Australia that do not live anywhere else
These include animals like the kangaroo the koala the emu the kookaburra and the platypus
People first arrived in Australia more than 50000 years ago
These native Australians are called the Australian Aborigines
For the history of Australia see History of Australia
Most of the Australian colonies having been settled from Britain became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901
The first Prime Minister of Australia was Edmund Barton in 1901
Australia is a member of the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations
It is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth II as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a GovernorGeneral who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia
Australia has six states two major mainland territories and other minor territories
The states are New South Wales Queensland South Australia Tasmania Victoria and Western Australia
The two major mainland territories are the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory ACT
In 2013 according to world bank Australia had just over 2313 million people
Most Australians live in cities along the coast such as Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth Darwin Hobart and Adelaide
The largest inland city is Canberra which is also the nations capital
The largest city is Sydney
Australia is a very big country but much of the land is very dry and the middle of the continent is mostly desert
Only the areas around the east west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable climate not too hot for many farms and cities
Corroboree in 1900  The Australian Aboriginal people arrived in Australia about 50000 years ago or even earlier
Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788 the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land
They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways
An example of Aboriginal land management was the Cumberland Plain where Sydney is now
Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees
This meant that a lot of grass grew back but not many big trees
Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains but not in forests
The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people
Sometimes Aborigines would name a person after an animal and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population
Aboriginal people did not usually build houses except huts of grass leaves and bark
They did not usually build walls or fences and there were no horses cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens
The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fishtraps made from stones piled up in the river and the remains of a few stone huts in Victoria and Tasmania
The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth
In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flakedstone spearheads but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood
Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making
The boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting
The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them
They believed that they had grown from the land so it was like their mother and they belonged to the land
In the 1600s Dutch merchants traded with the islands of Batavia now Indonesia to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia
The Dutch governor van Diemen sent Abel Tasman on a voyage of discovery and he found Tasmania which he named Van Diemens Land
Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it
The British Government was sure that there must be a very large land in the south that had not been explored
They sent Captain James Cook to the Pacific Ocean
His ship HMS Endeavour carried the famous scientists Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander who were going to Tahiti where they would watch the planet Venus pass in front of the Sun
Captain Cooks secret mission was to find Terra Australis the Land of the South
The voyage of discovery was very successful because they found New Zealand and sailed right around it
Then they sailed westward
At last a boy William Hicks who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon
Captain Cook named that bit of land Point Hicks
They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw New South Wales
At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food
Joseph Banks and Dr
Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were
They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England
Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life
He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit
But there were no houses and no fences
In most parts of the world people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land
But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way
They belonged to the land like a baby belongs to its mother
Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that noone owned the land
This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people
Arthur Phillip raises the British flag at Sydney in 1788  In the 1700s in England laws were tough many people were poor and gaols jails were full
A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread
Many people were hung for small crimes
But usually they were just thrown in gaol
Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America
But by the 1770s the colonies in America became the United States
They were free from British rule and would not take Englands convicts any more so England needed to find a new and less populated place
By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships
The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there
In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts sailors marines a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years
Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip
They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists
Captain Phillip found that Botany Bay was flat and windy
There was not much fresh water
He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was the finest harbor in the world
 There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on
On 26 January 1788 the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England and the new settlement was called Sydney
For the first few years of the settlement things were very difficult
Noone in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony
Nobody had chosen them carefully
There was only one man who was a farmer
There was noone among the convicts who was a builder a brickmaker or a blacksmith
Noone knew how to fix the tools when they broke
All of the cattle escaped
There were no cooking pots
All the plants were different so noone knew which ones could be eaten
It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation
Somehow the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor Arthur Phillip and another hut for the supply of food grew into a small town with streets a bridge over the stream a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships
By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor
There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today
Settlements had spread out from Sydney firstly to Norfolk Island and to Van Diemens Land Tasmania and also up the coast to Newcastle where coal was discovered and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd
Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney and by 1820 farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England
While the settlement was growing in New South Wales it was also growing in Tasmania
The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England and farmers found it easy to grow crops there
Lachlan Macquarie was the 5th governor of New South Wales and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place  Because Australia is such a very large land it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people
In the early days of the colony a great number of explorers went out searching for good land to settle on
When the settlers looked west from Sydney they saw a range of mountains which they called the Blue Mountains
They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years noone could find their way through them
In 1813 Gregory Blaxland William Lawson and a 17yearold called William Charles Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming
A road was built and the governor Lachlan Macquarie founded the town of Bathurst on the other side 100miles from Sydney
Some people like Captain Charles Sturt were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it
Many of the explorers did not prepare very well or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year
Some died like Burke and Wills
Ludwig Leichhardt got lost twice
The second time he was never seen again
Major Thomas Mitchell was one of the most successful explorers
He mapped the country as he went and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years
He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there
The Henty brothers had come from Tasmania had built themselves a house had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine
The gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold
The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry
By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people very rich
The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came
The people in Australia wanted to run their own country and not be told what to do from London
The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London
Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy
William Wentworth started the Australian Patriotic Association Australias first political party in 1835 to demand democratic government
In 1840 the city councils started and some people could vote
New South Wales Legislative Council had its first elections in 1843 again with some limits on who could vote
In 1855 limited selfgovernment was given by London to New South Wales Victoria South Australia and Tasmania
In 1855 the right to vote was given to all men over 21 in South Australia
The other colonies soon followed
Women were given the vote in the Parliament of South Australia in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections
Australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent
But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament
Parliament of Australia 9 May 1901 painted by Tom Roberts
Australia has had democracy since the 1850s   Until 1901 Australia was not a nation it was six separate colonies governed by Britain
They voted to join together to form one new country called the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901
Australia was still part of the British Empire and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia
But soon it had its own money and its own Army and Navy
In Australia at this time the trade unions were very strong and they started a political party the Australian Labor Party
Australia passed many laws to help the workers
In 1914 the First World War started in Europe
Australia joined in on the side of Britain against Germany AustriaHungary and the Ottoman Empire
Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli in the Ottoman Empire
They fought bravely but were beaten by the Turks
Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day
They also fought on the Western Front
More than 60000 Australians were killed
Australia had a really hard time in the Great Depression of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against Nazi Germany when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939
But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the Fall of Singapore by Japan
Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion
But with help from the United States Navy the Japanese were stopped
After the war Australia became a close friend of the United States
When the war ended Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work
So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war
It did things like building the Snowy Mountains Scheme
Over the next 25 years millions of people came to Australia
They came especially from Italy and Greece other countries in Europe
Later they also came from countries like Turkey and Lebanon
An important new party the Liberal Party of Australia was made by Robert Menzies in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972 then Gough Whitlam won for the Labor Party
Whitlam made changes but he made the Senate unhappy and the GovernorGeneral sacked him and forced an election in 1975
Then Malcolm Fraser won a few elections for the Liberal Party
In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from China Vietnam Malaysia and other countries in Asia
Australia became more multicultural
In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world helped by mining and wool
Australia started trading more with America than Japan

Australia had a bad recession in 1991 but when other Western countries had trouble with their economies in 2008 Australia stayed strong
Today Australia is a rich peaceful and democratic country
But it still has problems
Around 45 of Australians could not get a job in 2010
A lot of land in Australia like Uluru has been returned to Aboriginal people but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else
Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as immigrants to live in  Australia
These people may come because they want to do business or to live in a democracy to join their family or because they are refugees
Australia took 65 million immigrants in the 60 years after World War Two including around 660000 refugees

In science an object that is black absorbs the light that hits it
Because these objects do not reflect any light the human eye cant see any color coming from that object
The brain then sees these objects as black
A way to create black objects is to mix pigments
A pigment works by reflecting only the color of the pigment
For example a blue pigment absorbs all colors except blue
By mixing pigments in the right quantities black can be made
Because black objects absorb light they become warmer faster

British English is the kind of English language which is used in the United Kingdom and in most countries which previously were in the British Empire
In the United Kingdom many different people say words in different ways
For example a man from a place near London may not pronounce his rs the same as a man from Scotland or a man from Northern Ireland
Across the country the accent is different
For instance in Liverpool one speaks with a scouse accent and in London one speaks with a cockney accent
Different variations on all of British English exist from the manner in which words are pronounced to the manner in which they are spelt
One place people speak English in a different way is Cornwall where the Cornish dialect is spoken
Britain like other countries has languages other than English
In Wales many speak Welsh in Scotland some people speak Gaelic and in Ireland a few people speak Irish
However that is not the subject of this particular article
British English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English
Some British English words end in re because the words were originally taken from French
They are often simplified to er in American English 
British English centre litre metre A unit of distance Not to be confused with meter  a device for measuring 
American English center liter meter 
Some British English words end in our and are simplified to or in American English
The English spelling also came from the French language 
British English colour favour honour labour 
American English color favor honor labor 
Some British English words the have come originally from the Greek language use ph

British English Sulphur  American English Sulfur 
Some words in British English use ise where ize is used in American English
Spelling them with ize is also done in Britain sometimes
However this is very much frowned upon and would not be considered acceptable if writing for a British audience

American English colonization realization organization 
The word gray is also a special case as it is normally spelled gray in American English and grey in British English

httpwwwdigitasharvardeducgibinwikikenBritishVsAmerican British and American English differences  
Bankruptcy is a legal process which happens when a person or an organisation does not have enough money to pay all of its debts
Legally they are insolvent
Where it is a person who cannot pay their debts the persons creditors may ask the court to appoint a trustee in bankruptcy
This is a professional accountant who is appointed by the court and they will take control of the bankrupt persons assets
Some assets are protected by law but the trustee in bankruptcy will sell off all of the other assets and use the proceeds to pay as much of that persons debts as possible
After the process is complete the person is discharged from bankruptcy and the person is free from any further liability to pay those claims but normally that person will be limited in their ability to borrow money again because their credit rating will be damaged
Where it is an organisation who cannot pay their debts the creditors may ask the court to appoint a liquidator
The liquidator does a very similar job to the trustee in bankruptcy except that there are no assets which are protected so the liquidator can sell everything
Once all of the assets of the organisation have been sold the organisation is then dissolved and no longer exists
Organisations do not get discharged from bankruptcy in the same way that a living person does
People often confuse the terms bankruptcy and insolvency and sometimes they use one word when they really mean the other
Insolvency usually just means that a someone does not have enough money to pay their debts or sometimes that the total amount of their debts is worth more than the total amount of their assets
Bankruptcy is a formal legal process in front of the courts
Although the two terms are connected just because a person is insolvent does not necessarily mean that they will go into bankruptcy
Many countries have alternatives to bankruptcy to try and allow people and businesses to try and avoid the bankruptcy process
In various countries individual people can try and reach individual voluntary arrangements or IVAs with their creditors
This means that the creditors agree to take less money to discharge their debts
There are similar processes for companies and other organisations and they go by various different names in different countries but in many countries they are called schemes of arrangement
In many countries a company or business can ask the courts for bankruptcy protection to try and protect the business so that the creditors cannot destroy all of the physical capital and goodwill by breaking it apart and moving it away
The aim of this is provide is more time for the business to reorganise itself and to work out a new deal between the owners and the people the business owes money
In many countries this is called going into administration
However not all countries have bankruptcy protection laws for businesses
Often a creditor threatens a debtor with debt slavery in many parts of the world
In some cases the debtor does not know that they have a right to go bankrupt
This is a human rights problem in some countries
It is also called liquidation bankruptcy because some of a debtors property may be sold liquidated to satisfy creditors
A chapter 7 usually makes a company stop doing business
Employees often lose their jobs when company files for chapter 7
Chapter 11 bankruptcy is a complicated type of bankruptcy that reorganizes the debtors finances usually reducing the amount of debt owed and changing debt repayment terms
A Chapter 11 bankruptcy case allows a business to keep running while it finds ways to reduce and arrange payment of its debts
Almost all Chapter 11 bankruptcies are filed by businesses
Ordinary people do not usually file Chapter 11 bankruptcy because a Chapter 13 bankruptcy will almost always be cheaper and easier for them
Chapter 13 is the most popular form of bankruptcy in the United States for ordinary people
In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy some of your debts may be forgiven discharged but you will have to pay back a portion of your debt
The debt repayment plan is supervised by the bankruptcy court and usually lasts for three to five years
Businesses cannot file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy
Less common forms of bankruptcy may be filed under Chapter 9 and Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code

Clockwise from rightgrapes persimmon red gooseberries red currants top false berry blackberries are aggregate fruit and strawberries are accessory fruit The word berry is used for many different kinds of small fruits that have many seeds and can be used as food
Some examples are raspberry strawberry lingonberry and blueberry
When botanists talk about berries they mean a simple fruit produced from a single ovary
They sometimes call this true berry to distinguish it from false berries
By that statement of how words are used grapes or tomatoes are true berries
The berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of the pericarp which can be taken as food
The flowers of these plants have an upper ovary with one or more carpels
The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary
Berries are small sweet bright colored fruits
Due to this they are able to bring more animals towards them and spread their seeds
Some fruits that are called berries in English are not true berries by the use of words above
These include raspberries strawberry blackberries cranberries and boysenberries
Some true berries do not have berry in their name
These include tomatoes bananas eggplants guavas pomegranates and chillies
Pumpkins cucumbers melons oranges and lemons are also berries that have slightly different structure and may be called by different names pepo for pumpkins cucumbers and melons or hesperidium for oranges and lemons
Animals Hoverfly on a Compositae inflorescence Plants Wheat Fungi Morchella esculent Bacteria Archaea Haloarchaea Virus Gamma bacteriophage Biology is the science that studies life and living things and their evolution
Living things include animals plants fungi such as mushrooms and microorganisms such as bacteria and archaea
The term biology is relatively modern
It was introduced in 1802 and was immediately adopted by Lamarck
People who study biology are called biologists
Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work and what they are like
Biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment
It has existed as a science for about 200 years and was preceded by natural history
Biology has many research fields and branches
Like all sciences biology uses the scientific method
This means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves
Biology attempts to answer questions such as What are the characteristics of this living thing comparative anatomy How do the parts work physiology How should we group living things classification taxonomy What does this living thing do behaviour growth How does inheritance work genetics What has been the history of life palaeontology
How do organisms relate to their environment ecology
All modern biology is influenced by evolution which answers the question How has the living world come to be as it is

The bubonic plague was the disease that caused the Black Death which killed tens of millions of people in Europe in the Middle Ages
Symptoms of this disease include coughing fever and black spots on the skin
There are different kinds of Bubonic plague
The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of flea that lives on rats
Then there is an incubation period which can last from a few hours to about seven days
Sepsis happens when the bacterium enters the blood and makes it form tiny clots
This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs
About 95 of all people with this form will die
Incubation period is only one to two days
This is the most harmless form
It will result in a little fever
After that there are antibodies that protect against all forms for a long time
During the 1300s this epidemic struck parts of Asia North Africa and Europe
Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it
Unlike s that pull communities together this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke peoples trust in one another
Giovanni Boccaccio an Italian writer of the time described it This  had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers ed brothers uncles their nephews sisters their brothers and in many cases wives deserted their husbands
But even worse
fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children   Oriental rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis infected with the Yersinia pestis bacterium which appears as a dark mass in the gut
The foregut of this flea is blocked by a Y pestis biofilm when the flea attempts to feed on an uninfected host Y pestis from the foregut is regurgitated into the wound causing infection The plague was not just carried by rats as some people assume
The fleas also carried it
It came from abroad from Kaffa by the Black Sea
From there the disease started to go new places in 1347
It went to England in 1349
There it killed half of the people in England
70 of people who got plague died
Pigs are also to blame for the transmission as the bacteria stayed in their blood system and when eaten people caught the plague
This is a reason why so few Jews or Muslims caught the disease
In the 20th century some countries did research on the bacteria that causes bubonic plague
They did research to use it for biological warfare
Samples of this bacteria are carefully controlled
There is much paranoia fear about it
Dr
Thomas C
Butler a US expert in this organism was charged in October 2003 by the FBI with various crimes
This happened after he said he lost samples of Yersinia pestis
This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague
The FBI did not find the samples
They do not know what happened to them

Metazoa  Animals are eukaryotic organisms with many cells
They do not use light to get energy as plants do
The study of animals is called zoology
Animals use different ways to get energy from other living things
They usually eat other living things but some are parasites or have photosynthetic protists as symbionts
Plants are also multicellular eukaryotic organisms but most animals are mobile meaning they can move around
Animals take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide
This cellular respiration is part of their metabolism chemical working
In both these ways they are different from plants
Also the cells of animals have different cell membranes to other eukaryotes like plants and fungi
There are many types of animals
The common animals most people know are only about 3 of the animal kingdom
When biologists look at animals they find things that certain animals have in common
They use this to group the animals in a biological classification
They think several million species exist but they have only identified about one million
Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups the invertebrates and the vertebrates
Vertebrates have a backbone or spine invertebrates do not
Vertebrates are 
fish or fishes both ways are correct 
amphibians 
reptiles 
birds 
mammals  Some invertebrates are 
insects 
spiders 
crustaceans 
molluscs like a snail or squid 
worms 
jellyfish  In scientific usage humans are considered animals in everyday nonscientific usage humans are often not considered to be animals
The animal mode of nutrition is called heterotrophic because they get their food from other living organisms
Some animals eat only plants they are called herbivores
Other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores
Animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores
The environments animals live in vary greatly
By the process of evolution animals adapt to the habitats they live in
A fish is adapted to its life in water and a spider is adapted to a life catching and eating insects
A mammal living on the savannahs of East Africa lives quite a different life from a sea mammal like a dolphin or porpoise catching fish in the sea
The fossil record of animals goes back about 600 million years to the Ediacaran period or somewhat earlier
During the whole of this long time animals have been constantly evolving so that the animals alive on Earth today are very different from those on the edges of the seafloor in the Ediacaran
The study of ancient life is called palaeontology

Beijing is the capital of the Peoples Republic of China
The city used to be known as Peking
It is in the northern and eastern parts of the country
The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China
Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work
Nearly 15 million people live there
In 2008 Beijing hosted the Summer Olympic Games and will host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games
It will be the only city to host both
Beijing is well known for its ancient history
Since the Jin Dynasty Beijing has been the capital of several dynasties especially the later ones including the Yuan Ming and Qing
There are many places of historic interest in Beijing
The Mandarin Chinese name of the city is Bijng which means The Northern Capital
It got this name when the Yongle Emperor of the Ming family of rulers moved most of his government from Nanjing The Southern Capital in the early 1400s
In Chinese Beijings name is written 
Today people spell it Beijing because they use the pinyin way of spelling which shows what the name should sound like in Mandarin
People used to spell it Peking because that was the spelling used by some of the first people from Europe to visit the Ming and write home about it the Jesuits work was made popular by their French brother Du HaldeI p13 It then became the official Chinese Postal Map spelling around 1900 and continued to be used until pinyin became more popular
Beijing was also known as Beiping City of Northern Peace between 1928 and 1949 when the Nationalists moved the Chinese capital to Nanjing and Chongqing
The center of Beijing was settled in the 1st millennium BC
In those days the Kingdom of Yan  Yn set up their capital where Beijing is today
They called it Ji  J
After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed the city became smaller although it was still an important place
Beijing became more important again in the 10th century when the Jin dynasty set its capital there
This city was destroyed by Mongol forces in 1215
Then in 1267 Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital and called it Great Capital  Dd which was the beginning of modern Beijing
When Kublai Khan the Mongolian monarch set up the Yuan dynasty this city became his capital
The Yuan Dynasty Ming Dynasty and Qing dynasty all made Beijing their capital
When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing
When the Peoples Republic of China seized power Beijing became the capital of China again
In 1989 there were protests in Tiananmen Square because some people wanted democracy
Important places in Beijing include  
The Great Wall of China Chngchng in the mountains between Beijing and the grasslands of Mongolia 
The Forbidden City Ggng the most important home of the emperors of Ming and Qing China 
Tiananmen Square Tinnmn Gungchng surrounded by Chinas most important government buildings and museums 
Jingshan  Beihai Parks the hill overlooking the Forbidden City and the lake beside it with many temples 
The Summer Palace Yhyun and Old Summer Palace Yunmng Yun the more natural home of the last Qing emperors and what is left of an older one 
Prince Gongs Mansion a very nice old house for one of the Qing princes 
The Imperial Ancestral Temple Timio where the emperors remembered the earlier people in their families 
The Temple of Heaven Tintn and Temple of the Earth Dtn important places for Chinas old national religion 
The Temples of the Sun and the Moon other important places for Chinas old national religion 
The Temple of Confucius and Imperial Academy important places for Chinas old kind of education 
Niujie Mosque a place for Beijings Muslims and one of the citys oldest buildings 
The National and Urban Planning Museums 
Olympic Green the park left from the 2008 Beijing Olympics 
Marco Polo Bridge a very old bridge across the main river west of town 
Ming Tombs where many Ming emperors were buried 
Zhoukoudian caves in the mountains west of town where people lived long long ago   Beijing is the education center of Peoples Republic of China
More than 500 famous universities of China are in Beijing
They also include 5 of the top universities Peking University Tsinghua University China People University Beijing Normal University and Beihang University
Beijing is also education center of China for teaching Chinese as a foreign language
The standard Chinese pronunciation is based on Beijing dialect so over 70 foreigners who want to study Chinese go to Beijing for their studies

The Greek classical elements are fire air water and earth
In Greek philosophy science and medicine these make up a whole
Fire is both hot and dry 
Air is both hot and wet 
Water is both cold and wet 
Earth is both cold and dry
The image below has two squares on top of each other
The corners of one are the classical elements
The corners of the other are the properties
Galen said these elements were used by Hippocrates to describe the human body
The elements are linked to the four humours phlegm water yellow bile fire black bile earth and blood air
In Chinese Taoism the elements are metal wood water fire earth 
A continent is a large area of the land on Earth that is joined together
In general it is agreed there are seven continents in the world Africa Antarctica Asia Europe North America Australasia or Oceania and South America
World map with the current political division of countries In geography and politics a country is a political division
Some of the bestknown countries are Germany China India Russia the United Kingdom and the United States
There are 196 of them in the world or 195 if Taiwan is not counted as a country see territorial disputes
Most countries in the world are sovereign states meaning they are independent of each other
The term is most commonly used as both a state and a nation
193 of the worlds countries are part of the United Nations which recognises lots of countries and other dependent territories
A disputed territory is that territory whose sovereignty is jealously desired by two or more countries
Usually the administration of the territory is carried out by one of the countries that claims sovereignty while the other country does not recognise the sovereignty over the territory of the other country
This does not usually happen in land or sea areas on which none possesses effective control such as Antarctica or only partially
It can also be considered as a disputed territory to those areas that are given by two different governments and therefore are divided
One example is the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and Cyprus
As defined by Montevideo Convention a country has  
sovereignty over a geographic area 
a permanent population 
a defined territory 
one government 
enters relations with other states

Computer science is the study of manipulating managing transforming and encoding information
There are many different areas in computer science
Some areas consider problems in an abstract manner while some need special machines called computers
A person who works with computers will often need mathematics science and logic in order to design and work with computers
This is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things and the way to approach problems with this information
Computers can do some things easily for example simple math or sorting out a list of names from AtoZ
But computers cannot answer questions when there is not enough information or when there is no real answer
Also computers may take too much time to finish long 
For example it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the USA  so instead a computer will try to make a close guess
A computer will answer these simpler questions much faster
Algorithms are a specific set of instructions or steps on how to complete a task
For example a computer scientist wants to sort playing cards
There are many ways to sort them  by suits diamonds clubs hearts and spades or by numbers 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King and Ace
By deciding on a set of steps to sort the cards the scientist has created an algorithm
The scientist then needs to test whether this algorithm works
This shows how well and how fast the algorithm sorts cards
A simple but slow algorithm is drop the cards pick them up and check whether they are sorted
If they are not do it again
This method will work but it will take a very long time
A better algorithm is find the first card with the smallest suit and smallest number 2 of diamonds and place it at the start
After this look for the second card and so on
This algorithm is much faster and does not need much space
This sorting algorithm is called selection sort
Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer algorithm in 1843 for a computer that was never finished
Computers began during World War II
Computer science separated from the other sciences during the 1960s and 1970s
Now computer science has its own methods and has its own technical terms
It is related to electrical engineering mathematics and language science

Chemistry is a branch of  science that deals with chemical elements and compounds and how these things work together
It is the study of the materials things that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us
Before 1600 people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold but no one managed to do that
This was called alchemy
Alchemists separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it
They also processed special minerals from a mine in Sweden to get rare earth metals
Radioactivity was also discovered
Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements
Some are very common like oxygen
Many are very rare and expensive like platinum
Some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs like rutherfordium
Since the 1920s the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists theories about chemical reactions
With smaller and faster computers chemists have built better tools for analyzing substances
These tools have been sent to study chemicals on Mars
Police also use those tools to study evidence from crime s
There are several types of chemistry
Analytical chemistry looks at which  chemicals are in things
For example looking at how much arsenic is in food
Organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them
For example making acetylene
Inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them
One example is making an integrated circuit
A large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry
This looks at plastics
One example is making nylon
Because plastics are made of carbon polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry
Another area is biochemistry
This looks at the chemistry of living things
An example would be seeing how arsenic poisons people
Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry
There are many other small branches of chemistry
The basic unit of an element is called an atom
An atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down turning into a lighter element for example through nuclear fission or radioactive decay
A chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements
In a compound two or more atoms are joined together to form a molecule
The tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules
Mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted
An example would be mixing sand and salt
This can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately
Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction
An example would be heating sodium bicarbonate common baking soda
It will make water carbon dioxide and sodium carbonate
This reaction cannot be undone
One very important concept in chemistry is that different atoms interact with one another in very specific proportions
For example two hydrogen atoms interacting with one oxygen atom lead to the water molecule HO
This relationship is known as the Law of constant proportions and leads to the idea of stoichiometry a term that refers to the ratios of different atoms in chemical compounds
For example in water there are always exactly 2 hydrogen atoms to 1 oxygen atom
In carbon dioxide there are exactly 2 oxygen atoms for 1 carbon atom
These relationships are described using chemical formulas such as HO  two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom and CO one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms
Because atoms of different elements react with one another in very specific proportions but atoms of different elements have different weights chemists often describe the amount of different elements and compounds in terms of the number of moles
A mole of any element contains the same number of atoms  602214150000000000000000 atoms
The atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole
For example the atomic mass of copper is about 6355
That means about 6355 grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms
The atomic mass of chlorine is about 3545
That means 3545 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it
Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds too
CopperII chloride is an example
CuCl is its chemical formula
There is one copper atom 6355 and two chlorine atoms 3545  2  7090
Add all the molar masses of the elements together to get the molar mass of the chemical compound 6355  7090  13445
That means in 13445 grams of copperII chloride there is one mole of copperII chloride molecules
This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants chemicals that are reacted should be left
If too much reactant is used there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction
Acids and bases are common chemicals
Acids release H ions when in water and bases release OH ions when in water
Acids can react with bases
The H ion is taken from the acid by the base
This makes water HO
A salt is also made when an acid and a base react together
An example would be reacting hydrochloric acid HCl and sodium hydroxide NaOH
Hydrochloric acid releases H and Cl ions in water
The base releases Na and OH ions
The H and the OH react to make water
There is a solution of sodium chloride NaCl left
Sodium chloride is a salt
Chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science
Most objects are made by chemists people who do chemistry
Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances
Chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we use every day
glasses a lab coat and gloves
He is looking at a rock from the moon Many chemicals are harmless but there are some chemicals that are dangerous
For example mercuryII chloride is very 
Chromates can cause cancer
TinII chloride pollutes water easily
Hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns
Some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire
To stay safe chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab
They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained
The chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly

Colchester is a town in the northern part of the English county of Essex
It has a population of 104000 people
People believe that Colchester is the oldest Roman town in England
Before Roman times Colchester was Camulodunon
This is a Celtic name that came from Camulos
Camulos was the Celtic god of war
The Romans called Colchester Camulodunum written CAMVLODVNVM and made it the capital of Roman Britain
Colchester was attacked and burnt by Boudicca in 61 AD
The church at the Benedictine abbey of Saint John the Baptist was destroyed in 1539
This action was part of the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII
Only a gate remains that people still go to visit
King Cunobelinus or Cunobelin was from Colchester
Colchester is twinned with the following cities

A Creator is a person who creates something
In some religions Judaism Christianity Islam God or Allah meaning the God in Arabic is the most important and original Creator of the whole Universe  including Man who is made in his image see Genesis to observe it and control it like God
The idea that anything that a person is creating like an idea can be owned as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions
In other traditions Buddhism Native American mythology anyone has this potential for creating and can become part of the greater creating of the universe
Stewardship of home land and all of Earth is a test for participating in this or just good sense

atalhyk CIA World Factbook  Cartography is making maps
It is part of geography
How people make maps is always changing
In the past maps were drawn by hand but today most printed maps are made using computers and people usually see maps on computer screen  Maps are of two main types  
General maps with a variety of features
Thematic maps with particular themes for specific audiences
General maps are produced in a series
Governments produce them in largerscale and smallerscale maps of great detail
Thematic maps are now very common
They are necessary to show spatial cultural and social data
Chorizo is a pork pigmeat sausage which people first made in the Iberian Peninsula
It is made with large pieces of fatty pork chili pepper and paprika
The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it
In the western hemisphere the Mexican and Caribbean types are better known
These types of chorizo are made with smaller pieces of pork and different seasonings and peppers are used
Cured smoked chorizo is edible and can be eaten without cooking
Fresh chorizo must be cooked before eating
It can be eaten by its self or as part of meal
It can also be used in place of ground beef or pork
Cosmology is the branch of astronomy that deals with the origin structure evolution and spacetime relationships of the universe
NASA defines cosmology as The study of the structure and changes in the present universe
Another definition of cosmology is the study of the universe and humanitys place in it
Modern cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory which brings together observational astronomy and particle physics
Though the word cosmology is recent first used in 1730 in Christian Wolffs Cosmologia Generalis the study of the universe has a long history
Until recently people thought that the universe was the Milky Way
They thought this because they could only see the planets up to Saturn and stars
With the invention of the telescope our universe got bigger
Even in the 20th century people thought that the Milky Way was the universe
With the Hubble Space Telescope people could see things far away

That group of people is often called the South American Indians
They probably came from North America
Some of them were hunters and gatherers but others were farmers
Pedro lvares Cabral was the first European to see Brazil
He saw it in 1500
He was from Portugal and the Portuguese government claimed Brazil
Soon explorers explored the whole coastline of Brazil and colonies were set up
In the late 1500s and early 1600s the Dutch and the French would sometimes try to take land in Brazil
Brazilians started moving inland farther than the Treaty of Tordesillas said they could
This caused some fights with the Spaniards and native people in the area
Its people are called Brazilians or Brasileiros In Portuguese
The people include citizens of Portuguese or other European descent who mainly live in the South and Southeast Africans Native Americans Arabs Gypsies and people of Mixed ancestry
Brazil also has the largest Japanese community outside Japan
Other East Asians follow the Japanese group
Two major sporting events were held in Brazil recently the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro

Creativity is the ability of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable or the process of making something new and useful or valuable
It happens in all areas of life  science art literature and music
As a personal ability it is very difficult to measure
The reason is that we dont understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others
Judging what is creative is also controversial
Some people say only things which are historically new are creative while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them then it is also creativity
Some think creativity is an important thing that makes humans different from apes
Others recognize that even apes other primates other mammals and some birds adapt to survive by being creative for example  primates using tools
Liane Gabora believes that all culture comes from creativity not imitation
Therefore these people say human science should focus on it pay special attention to it Ethics for example would focus on finding creative solutions to ethical dilemmas
Politics would focus on the political virtues that need some creativity
Imitation would not be the focus of education
Linguistics might be more interested in how new words are created by culture rather than in how existing ones are used in grammar
Intellectual interests recognized as intellectual rights or intellectual property in the law are a way to reward creativity in law but they do not always work very well
A good example is copyright which is supposed to pay authors and artists but may only pay lawyers to make imitative arguments in court
Creativity is a central question in economics where it is known as ingenuity the ability to come up with new ideas or individual capital  capacities that individuals have that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already
This is separate from the instructional capital that might try to capture some of that in a patent or training system that helps others do what the individual leader or  of the system can do
In urban economics there are various ways to measure creativity  the Bohemian Index and Gay Index are two attempts to do this  and predict the economic growth of cities based on creativity

When someone makes a creation like a book movie picture song or website they can say how this creation should be used
This is called copyright and there are laws that protect it
For someone else to use the creation they need to get  from the creator or pay a fee
Laws about copyright were created so that people who write books or songs or make web pages or movies could get money for their work
Someone writes a book and want to sell it
People who want to read the book have to pay the author to get copies of it
He would not want someone else to sell a stolen version of the book and get money for the work he had done
The author also wants people to know that he was the first person who could write a book like that one if the book is good it means the author is good at writing people who know the author is good at writing may hire the author to write things for them

wok Cooking is a process to make food ready to eat by heating it
Cooking can kill bacteria that may be in the food
Raw food is food that is not cooked
Some foods are good to eat raw
Other foods are not good for the body when they are raw so they must be cooked
Some foods are good to eat either raw or cooked
Cooking is often done in a kitchen using a stove or an oven
It can also be done over a fire for example over a campfire or on a barbecue
The heat for cooking can be made in different ways
It can be from an open fire that burns wood or charcoal
It can be on a stove or in an oven that uses propane natural gas or electricity
There are several different ways to cook food
Boiling cooks food in hot water
Frying deep or shallow cooks food in hot butter fat or oil
Baking and roasting cook food by surrounding it with hot air
Grilling means cooking food on a metal grill that has heat under it
People often cook meat by boiling roasting frying or grilling it
Some foods such as bread or pastries are usually baked
Usually food is cooked in some kind of pot or pan
Sometimes people cook food by putting it directly into the fire or by wrapping the food in leaves before they put it into the fire
A person whose job it is to cook food may be called a cook or a chef
The word cooker means a machine or tool that a cook might use to cook food
Rice cookers and pressure cookers are examples

Carcassonne in the year 120 Peyrepertuse
This castle was one of the last Cathar strongholds to fal  The Cathar  was a version of Christianity
They were usually considered Gnostics
The word Cathar comes the Greek word katharos meaning unpolluted from Tobias Churton The Gnostics or  the pure ones
The Cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god
They believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world but inside their bodies there was a spirit and that spirit needed to return to the good god
They were famous for a belief in a form of reincarnation and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that persons spirit in a new body
They believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing
They were opposed to the doctrine of sin
Women were prominent in the faith
They were pacifists
They didnt eat anything that was made from other animals including meat and cows milk
The only  to this was fish
Fish was OK to eat because they believed fishes were not alive but just things that were sometimes produced from dirt and water
They preached tolerance of other faiths
They rejected the usual Christian rules of marriage and only believed in the New Testament
An earlier 10thcentury Bulgarian heresy Bogomilism and also Manichaeism started some of these trends
They used a bible in the language people spoke
Many other Christians used a Bible in Latin
Latin was spoken only by the priests
In 1145 open challenge to Catholic dominance began
In about 1165 the first Cathars said that the Church was full of ravening starving wolves and hypocrites and worshipping the wrong God right in front of the most powerful Catholics
In 1166 the Council of Oxford in England wiped out the English Cathars
It was also suppressed in Northern France
In 1167 Cathar bishops met to discuss organizing a counter Church  in the South of France the Languedoc nobles protected it and many noble women became Perfects
Parish clergy had low morale or confidence
The Catholic Church was against Catharism seeing it as a heresy
In the South of France there was tremendous religious fervor and an economy that was starting to grow and a social class of  merchants and  peasants was starting to grow
Peasants owned their own land
Meanwhile in other parts of Europe peasants were forced to give up their land to nobles and become serfs or slaves  the system of feudalism
There was a strong central absolute monarchy that did not exist in the South of France
The burghers and bankers had more power in this looser system
R I Moore is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack
However there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems  Troubadors who combined some of the traditions of the Bards of the Celts and Jews were both part of the multicultural society in the South of France
Their influences were not appreciated by local or Roman Church figures
The 12th century Roman Catholic Monks were founding their monasteries outside the towns drawing the best people there
The Cathars thus had little competition
The Cathar Perfects the socalled Good Men or Good Women lived restrained lives and spread their faith in towns  where the Catholics in general did not have their best agents
Also Cathars preached that only these Good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives  lay people could repent only on their deathbeds
Many 20th century Christian sects have similar beliefs
The Pope ordered a crusade against the Cathars in southern France
He said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as a crusader who went to the Holy Land
This was an absolution of all sin
In the Launguedoc on the 22nd of July 1209 a force of about 30000 Crusaders arrived at the walls of Beziers bearing the cross pattee to mislead and create ease among the Cathars thinking they were friend not foe and  demanded that about 200 Cathars be surrendered
The people of the town who were mostly Catholic said that rather than turn over their friends and family we would rather be flayed alive
    A mistake by the defenders of Beziers let thousands of attackers in
Arnauld Amaury made the famous quote Kill them all god knows his own  on being asked how to tell who were Cathars during the assault
Everyone in the town was killed some while taking refuge in the church
It is guessed that 20000 were killed many of whom were Catholics and not Cathars at all
The crusade became known as the Albigensian crusade after the town of Albi
It was to wipe out the Cathars almost entirely over forty or so years
The Crusaders wanted to go home but were ordered by the Pope to continue until the whole South of France was controlled and all Cathars were dead
In 1210 they attacked the fortress at Minerv and built the first great bonfire of heretics  beginning the practice of burning at the stake that would continue in the Inquisition of the CounterReformation
It is interesting to note that at the siege of Montsegur when the fires were lit the Cathars ran down the hill and threw themselves on as their beliefs were very strong
Catharism disappeared from the northern Italian cities after the 1260s pressured by the Inquisition
The last known Cathar perfectus in the Languedoc Guillaume Blibaste was killed in 1321

Time Cube is a website created by Gene Ray
On that website Dr
Ray explains his Time Cube theory which describes the planet Earth as having a cubic symmetry and time as rotating four corners
He also says that all of modern physics is wrong
Scientists reject these ideas saying that they make no sense and cannot be tested
The Time Cube website is written in an angry and hateful voice
On his site Ray says that anyone who does not believe in Time Cube is stupid and evil
Some of the comments are racist and discriminatory especially against black people and Jews
There are also many comments against gay people
Many people find the site to be difficult to understand
Ray has spoken about Time Cube at two universities in the United States MIT and Georgia Tech
At MIT a professor tried to cancel the lecture before it took place
Ray believes this is proof of a conspiracy to keep information about Time Cube hidden
The Census of Marine Life is a tenyear survey of life in the oceans starting in 2000
Its head is Ron ODor of Dalhousie University in Halifax Nova Scotia Canada
It uses data from researchers all over the world
More than 70 nations are involved and over a billion US dollars will be spent on it
It is a major work of marine ecology
It was founded by J Frederick Grassle
It is trying to do what the World Wide Fund for Nature WWF and National Geographic Society did for terrestrial ecoregions  say exactly what is alive on the planet
In this case in the seas

Civics is the study of government
It most often refers to studying government in high school to prepare to be a good citizen
In college civics is usually called political science
Since a city has the most unsimple government problems the word for this study is like that for city
Theories of civics can be grouped as  
Anarchist 
Capitalist 
Democrat 
Green 
Libertarian 
Republican    
Justice   A crime or misdemeanor or felony is an act done by a person which is against the laws of a country or region
A person who does this is called a criminal
The basic idea of what things are called crimes is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person
Things like killing another person injuring another person or stealing from another person are crimes in most countries
Also it can be a crime to have or sell contraband such as guns or illegal drugs
When some criminals make money from crime they try to stop the police finding out where the money came from by money laundering
Men and boys commit many more crimes than women and girls
There are various levels of crimes
In some jurisdictions they are 
misdemeanor  a minor crime typically punished by a fee or less than 1 year in jail 
felony or high crime  a major crime typically punished by 1 year or longer in prison
Different countries have different ideas of what things are crimes and which ones are the worst
Some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries
Many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from religions or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created
For example a religion might consider eating a particular food to be a crime
When automobiles became numerous they killed or hurt many people in road accidents so new laws were made for them
In many countries if people say they made or wrote a book movie song or Web page that they did not really make or write it is a crime against copyright laws
In many countries helping to grow make move or sell illegal drugs is a crime
In most countries police try to stop crimes and to find criminals
When the police find someone who they think might be a criminal they usually hold the person in a jail
Then usually a court or a judge decides if the person really did a crime
If the court or judge decides that the person really did it then he or she might have to pay a fine or go to prison
Sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be executed killed
This is called Capital punishment or the Death Penalty
There are countries in the world that execute criminals and others that do not
In many countries two conditions must exist for an act to be criminal 
Mens rea  occurs when the offence is committed with intent or knowledge or recklessness guilty mind 
Actus rea  a wrongful deed  Both must be present for the act to be considered a crime
Maize called corn in some countries is Zea mays a member of the grass family Poaceae
It is a cereal grain which was first grown by people in ancient Central America
It is now the third most important cereal crop in the world
However little of this maize is eaten directly by humans
Most is used to make corn ethanol animal feed and other maize products such as corn starch and corn syrup
Maize is a leafy stalk whose kernels have seeds inside
It is an angiosperm which means that its seeds are enclosed inside a fruit or shell
It is has long been a staple food by many people in Mexico Central and South America and parts of Africa
In Europe and the rest of North America maize is grown mostly for use as animal feed
In Canada and the United States maize is commonly referred to as corn
Centuries of cross breeding have produced larger plants and specialized varieties
Corn has become an important ingredient in American foods through the use of corn starch
People have long eaten sweet corn and popcorn with little processing and other kinds after processing into flour for making cornbread tortilla   There are five species and many subspecies in the genus
They are all plants similar to the cultivated maize with less developed cobs
The wild ones are sometimes called teosintes and they are all native to Mesoamerica

A coin is normally a round piece of metal that is used as currency or money
Coins have been made for about 2600 years the first place to make coins was Lydia modern Turkey
These coins were made of Precious metals and allowed people to trade with a standard amount of metal
Most people use coins as currency
They usually have lower value than banknotes
Most are made in government mints
Many coins have unique or complicated decorations one side often has the picture of a famous or important persons head on it
The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things randomly
This is called tossing a coin
A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it
You then look at which side is facing up
If the head is facing up it is called heads if the other side is facing up it is called tails
Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means
Tossing a coin can be a type of gambling which is illegal against the law in some countries
Some people see coins as a sign of greed such as some Communists and Puritans who sometimes condemn overhoarding of coins and ascetics who often keep little in the ways of money coins leading a poorlifestyle
Because coins have been made for a very long time some people collect old coins
They can be much cheaper than other old things especially if they are made of cheap metals like copper
Older coins normally cost more than newer ones but rarity matters moresome coins from the 1920s cost vast sums while some Roman coins cost very little
Computer  2012   A computer is a machine mostly electronic that is able to accept data as input process that data using predefined algorithms and data structures and perform tasks as output  including the transformation of raw data into information then knowledge and finally insight about the datas domain
Output also takes the form of the performance of physical tasks as well as data storage data transformation and data retrieval
Computers can also form networks with other computers for the purposes of data interchange and leveraging a distributed programming model for parallel processing
The primary use of computers is to solve human problems  including mathematical problems scientific problems healthcare problems business problems economics problems social problems the human need to create and distribute art and computational artifacts and to provide a means of communication between humans between computerized devices and directly between humans and computers
Calculating machines are old in the history of technology
Early examples are the astrolabe and the abacus
Today a computer is a programmable machine
The two principal characteristics of a computer are It responds to a specific instruction set in a welldefined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions a program
There are four main processing steps in a computer inputting storage outputting and processing
Modern computers are very different from early computers
They can do billions of calculations per second
Most people have used a personal computer in their home or at work
Computers do many different jobs where automation is useful
Some examples are controlling traffic lights vehicle computers security systems washing machines and digital televisions
A computer user can control it by a user interface
Input devices include keyboard mouse buttons and touch screen  Historians disagree on which early machines are computers
Many say the castle clock an astronomical clock invented by AlJazari in 1206 is the first known programmable analog computer
The length of day and night could be adjusted every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year
Ada Lovelace is considered to be the first programmer
At the end of the Middle Ages people in Europe thought math and engineering were more important
In 1623 Wilhelm Schickard made a mechanical calculator
Other Europeans made more calculators after him
They were not modern computers because they could only add subtract and multiply you could not change what they did to make them do something like play Tetris
Because of this we say they were not programmable
Now engineers use computers to design and plan
In 1801 Joseph Marie Jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave
He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do and he could change the punch cards which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted
This means the loom was programmable
Charles Babbage wanted to make a similar machine that could calculate
He called it The Analytical Engine
Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea he never built his Analytical Engine
As time went on computers were used more
People get bored easily doing the same thing over and over
Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards storing them and then having to go find them again
The US Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that
It was expensive and reports took a long time
Then an engineer worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work
Herman Hollerith invented a tabulating machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected
The Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation which later became IBM made his machines
They leased the machines instead of selling them
Makers of machines had long helped their users understand and repair them and CTRs tech support was especially good
Because of machines like this new ways of talking to these machines were invented and new types of machines were invented and eventually the computer as we know it was born

A modern suburb can be seen in the background 	 A city is a place where many people live together
A city has many buildings and streets
It has houses or apartments for many people to live shops where they may buy things places for people to work and a government organisation to run the city and to keep law and  in the city
People live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there
A city usually has a city centre where government and business take place and places called suburbs where people live around the outside of the centre
Tirana capital of Albania There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called city and other places are called town
Some things that make a city are  
A long history
Although many cities today have only been around for tens or hundreds of years there are a few which have been so for thousands of years
For example Athens Greece was founded in 1000 BC and Rome Italy has existed since 700 BC 
A large population
Cities can have millions of people living in and around them
Among them is Tokyo Japan and the Tokyo Metropolis around it which includes Yokohama and Chiba 
A centre where business and government takes place
The first case is often described as the financial capital such as Frankfurt in Germany
The second case is true for different levels of government whether they are local or part of a larger region for example Atlanta Georgia or an entire country for example Washington DC
Cities which contain the government of the region it is in are called capitals
Almost every country has its own capital 
Special powers called town privileges which have been given by the government of the country or its ruler
This was done especially in Europe during the Middle Ages 
Having a cathedral or a university
This rule is found in the United Kingdom
The smallest cathedral cities are St Davids and St Asaphs which are both in Wales and Ripon and Wells which are in England
In American English people often call all places where many people live cities See below Size of cities      Tokyo is the worlds most populous metropolitan area The sizes of cities can be very different
This depends on the type of city that it is
Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much are very much smaller than modern cities
There are two main reasons
One reason is that old cities often have a city wall and most of the city is inside it
Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow
If the city got too big it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the market place
People in cities need food and the food always has to come from outside the city
Cities that were on a river like London could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like Sienna in Italy because the river made a transport route for carrying food and other goods as well as for transporting people
London has been changing continually for hundreds of years while Siena which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years
Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large because the streets are wide enough for cars buses and trucks and there are often railway lines as well
In the US the word city is often used for towns that are not very big
When the first European people went to America they gave the name city to new places
They hoped the places would be great cities in the future
For example Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people
When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City for the nearby Great Salt Lake
Now 150 years later it really is a big city
In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger
The whole area is often called a metropolis and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages
The metropolis of London includes the City of London the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill Southwark Richmond Greenwich and etc The part that is officially known as the City of London only takes up one square mile
The rest is known as Greater London
Many other cities have grown in the same way
These giant cities can be exciting places to live and many people can find good jobs there but modern cities also have many problems
Many people cannot find jobs in the cities and have to get money by begging or by crime
Cars factories and waste create a lot of pollution that makes people sick
the smallest city is Urban historyFrance   Urban History is history of civilization
The first cities were made in ancient times as soon as people began to create civilization
Famous ancient cities which fell to ruins included Babylon Troy Mycenae and Mohenjo Daro
Benares in northern India is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years
Other cities that have existed since ancient times are Athens in Greece Rome and Volterra in Italy Alexandria in Egypt and York in England
In Europe in the Middle Ages being a city was a special  granted by nobility
Cities that fall into this category usually had or still have city walls
The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not
Medieval cities that still have walls include Carcassonne in France Tehran in Iran Toledo in Spain and Canterbury in England
In the United Kingdom a city is a town which people have always called a city or which has got the name city status by royal charter a special paper from the king or queen
Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important
In the past cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university
Some cathedral cities for example St Davids are small and people do not normally think of them as cities
Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges
The university cities of Oxford and Cambridge are famous throughout the world
The largest city is Shanghai while the fastest growing is Dubai
The smallest city in the UK is Wells
Rio de Janeiro a city famous for its beauty large slums lie between the richest districts

Ethiopia The information that follows applies mostly to the historical practice of the Church of England
A church is a building that was constructed to allow people to meet to worship together
These people are usually Christians or influenced by Christianity
Some other religious groups also call their religious buildings churches
Depending on the number of people that are in a community the churches come in different sizes
Small churches are called chapels
The churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the diocese
Each diocese has a cathedral
In most cases the cathedral is a very big church
Cathedrals are the seat of bishops
Edinburgh Scotland Ohio Berlin Germany is a 13th century church    the largest Romanesque building still in existence  is one of the main sights in Paris France  In the early days of Christianity people had to worship in secret
Christian worship was not allowed in the Roman empire so Christians had to meet in a secret place
Sometimes they met in peoples houses or barns sometimes they met underground
The first places that were built for Christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered
After the death of the Roman emperor Constantine in 337 AD
Christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in
These first churches were built on a similar plan to Roman basilicas
This plan was later used for the fine Gothic cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the Middle Ages
There are several parts in the architecture of a church
Not all churches will have all these parts  
The nave is the main part of the church where the congregation the people who come to worship sit
The aisles are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave 
The transept if there is one is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church
This makes the church shaped like a cross which is a symbol of Jesuss death on a cross 
The chancel leads up to the altar at the top of the church
The altar is in the sanctuary
The word sanctuary means sacred place
People were not allowed to be arrested in the sanctuary so they were safe
The altar is usually at the east end of the church
People in the church sit facing the altar
We say that the church faces east 
Churches will also have a tower or steeple usually at the west end
If the church has a transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept
In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup bowl of holy water near the entrance of the church
This tradition comes from the fact that Roman basilicas had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance
The font is a bowl where people often babies are baptized
This is also near the entrance of the church
This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church
Traditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on
These are called pews
Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions
At the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest preaches these talks are called sermons
There is also a lectern like a large music stand from where the lessons the Bible readings are read
If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be pillars which hold up the roof
In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars
This is called the triforium
Over the triforium is the clerestory which is a row of windows high up in the church wall
The chancel is the most holy part of the church and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone or occasionally iron
The congregation can see through the screen
On the top of the screen there may be a cross
This is called a rood pronounce like rude screen
Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the epistle and the gospel
Sometimes people sang from there
Inside the chancel are the benches where the choir sit
These are called choir stalls
They are on both sides
The two sides of the choir sit facing one another
The choir members who sit on the left north side are called cantoris the side where the cantor sits and those on the right south side are called decani the side where the deacon sits
In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up
The top of these seats when they are tipped up are called misericords from the Latin word for mercy
This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time
Sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through
These are called squints
If there is a recess in the wall it is called an aumbry
It is a cupboard for communion wine and bread that have been consecrated by a priest
The altar may be right at the east end of the church but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward
In that case the very east end is called an apse
Sometimes it is a separate chapel called the Lady Chapel
The design of churches changed a lot during the course of history
Often churches were made bigger
When this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles
These styles vary a lot in different countries
In English churches there were several different periods of architecture  
The Saxon period 7001050 was a time when churches were very simple
The end of the church end of the sanctuary was often rounded
Hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of wood 
The Norman period 10501190 came from the style called Romanesque which was popular in Europe
The arches had ornaments which were called mouldings
The tops of the pillars looked like cushions so they were called cushion capitals
The windows were narrow and rounded at the top 
Early English or Gothic architecture 11901280 was not as solid and heavy as Norman architecture
Towers were elegant and tall like the tower of Salisbury Cathedral 
The Decorated style of architecture 12801360was popular at a time when the plague Black Death was raging and a third of the people in England died
For that reason not so much building was done then
There were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time 
The Perpendicular style 13601540 was very grand
It had lots of straight upward lines and fan vaulting
This can be seen in Westminster Abbey and Kings College Chapel Cambridge
Many churches that can be seen in England were built in this period
In the 1600s churches were built in a variety of styles
Often they copied some of the older styles
After the Great Fire of London many new churches were built by the architect Sir Christopher Wren
They were built in the classical style
Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this but also the Gothic style continued to be used
Modern churches often do not have the traditional crossshape
It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel
Modern churches bring the congregation choir and priests in closer touch
An example is the round design for the Church of Christ the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes
Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches
Many have beautiful mosaic glass windows
Coventry Cathedral is a famous example of a modern church building

Belgium officially the Kingdom of Belgium is a federal state in Western Europe
Belgium has an area of 
Around 11 million people live in Belgium
It is a founding member of the European Union and is home to its headquarters
The capital city of Belgium is Brussels where the European Union NATO and other famous organisations are based
There are three regions in Belgium 
Flanders is the name of the northern half of Belgium just south of the Netherlands
Most of the people in this region called the Flemish people speak Dutch 
Wallonia is the name of the southern half of Belgium just north of France
Here most of the people the Walloons speak French
There is a small part of Wallonia next to the border with Germany where the people speak German 
The BrusselsCapital Region where the capital of Brussels is found is in the middle of the country but surrounded by Flanders on all sides
It used to be Dutchspeaking but today French is mostly spoken with some Dutch
The population is about 60 Dutchspeaking 39 Frenchspeaking and 1 Germanspeaking the socalled Deutschbelgier
To look after all these groups Belgium has a complicated system of government
Seventeen Provinces orange brown and yellow areas and the Bishopric of Lige green Philippe of Belgium current King The name Belgium comes from Gallia Belgica
This was a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul
Before Roman invasion in 100BC  the Belgae a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples lived there
The Germanic Frankish tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the Merovingian kings
A slow shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to change into the Carolingian Empire
The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the region into Middle and West Francia
They were vassals either of the King of France or of the Holy Roman Emperor
The Eighty Years War 15681648 divided the Low Countries into the northern United Provinces and the Southern Netherlands
Southern Netherlands were ruled by the Spanish and the Austrian Habsburgs
This made up most of modern Belgium
After the  the Low Countries were added into the French First Republic
This ended Austrian rule in the area
Adding back the Low Countries formed the United Kingdom of the Netherlands
This happened at the end of the First French Empire in 1815
The Belgian Revolution was in 1830
LeopoldI became king on  1831
This is now celebrated as Belgiums National Day
The Berlin Conference of 1885 gave control of the Congo Free State to King LeopoldII
This was for him personally and not for the country of Belgium
Starting in about 1900 many people did not like how he treated the Congolese people
In 1908 the Belgian state took control of the colony
It was then called the Belgian Congo
Germany invaded Belgium in 1914
This was part of World WarI
The opening months of the war were very bad in Belgium
During the war Belgium took over the of RuandaUrundi modern day Rwanda and Burundi
After the First World War the Prussian districts of Eupen and Malmedy were added into Belgium in 1925
The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940 and under German control until 1944
After World WarII the people made king LeopoldIII leave his throne in 1951
This is because they thought he helped the Germans
In 1960 the Belgian Congo stopped being under Belgian rule
Two years later RuandaUrundi also became free
Belgium joined NATO as a founding member
Since 1993 Belgium is a federal state divided into three regions and three communities
Regions

Germanspeaking Community of Belgium  It has a system of government known as a constitutional monarchy meaning that it has a monarch but that the monarch does not rule the country and that a government is elected democratically
Belgium has had its own monarchy since 1831
King Albert II left the throne on July 21 2013 and the current king is Philippe
In Belgium the government is elected
Between mid2010 and late 2011 after no clear result in the election Belgium had no official government until Elio Di Rupo became Prime Minister
Flanders and Wallonia both also have their own regional governments and there is a notable independence movement in Flanders
Charles Michel is currently the Prime Minister
Belgium is next to France Germany Luxembourg and the Netherlands
Its total area is 33990 square kilometers
The land area alone is 30528km
Belgium has three main geographical regions
The coastal plain is in the northwest
The central plateau are part of the AngloBelgian Basin
The Ardennes uplands are in the southeast
The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgiums southernmost tip Belgian Lorraine
The coastal plain is mostly sand dunes and polders
Further inland is a smooth slowly rising landscape
There are fertile valleys
The hills have many forests
The plateaus of the Ardennes are more rough and rocky
They have caves and small narrow valleys
Signal de Botrange is the countrys highest point at 694 metres 2277ft
Belgium is divided into three Regions
Flanders and Wallonia are divided into provinces
The third Region Brussels is not part of any province
A conceptual metaphor or cognitive metaphor is a metaphor which refers to one domain group of ideas in terms of another
For example treating quantity in terms of direction Prices are rising I attacked every weak point in his argument Argument as war rather than enquiry or search for truth Life is a journey Love talked about as if it were war or competition Time talked about as if it were a path through space or a quantity that can be saved or spent or wasted
The idea of a conceptual metaphor came from a book by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in 1980 Metaphors we live by The most recent linguistic approach to literature is that of cognitive metaphor which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language but a mode of thought
Donald Freeman
A convention is to write conceptual metaphors in small capital letters eg  with the target domain idea being referred to first here money and the source domain terms used to refer to it second

Cytology is the study of the cells especially their appearance and structure
Cells are the small parts that make up all living things and their effects on each other and their environment
There are two types of cells
Prokaryotic cells do not have a clear and easytosee nucleus and do not have a membrane or wall around them
Eukaryotic cells have an easytosee nucleus where all of the cells functions take place and a membrane around them
The main organelles of a cell and their uses are  
Mitochondria produces energy for the cell 
Endoplasmic reticulum makes proteins and carbohydrates for the cell to use 
Golgi bodies store and package products that the cell uses 
Plastid present in plant cells only contains chemicals needed to photosynthesize create energy from sunlight in plants only 
Nucleus directs the actions of the cell 
Centrosomes guides the cell in mitosis and meiosis the processes for cell division
Cell biology is mostly about how cells work and about cell division and molecular biology 
Histology deals with techniques for looking at tissues under a microscope
Cheese is milk made into a solid form that is edible
There are many types of cheese such as cheddar Swiss and provolone
Many things affect the form texture color and flavor of a cheese
These include the milk cow or goat if the milk has been pasteurized the amount of butterfat bacteria and mold in the cheese how the cheese is made how much fat is in the cheese and how old the cheese is
For some cheeses the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice
Most cheeses are acidified by bacteria
This bacteria turns milk sugars into lactic acid
Rennet is then used to finish the curdling
Vegetarian alternatives to rennet can also be used
Most of these are made by fermentation of a fungus called Mucor miehei
Other alternatives use species of the Cynara thistle family
People have been making cheese since before history was written down
It is not known when cheese was first made
It is known that cheese was eaten by the Sumerians in about 4000 BC
Cheese is made using milk
The milk of cows goats and sheep are most popular
Buffalo camel donkey and even hippopotamus milk can also be used
Cheese makers usually cook the milk in large pots
They add salt and a substance from the stomach of young cows called rennet
This curdles the cheese and makes it solid
Some makers do not add rennet
They curdle the cheese in other ways
Cheese made in factories is often curdled by using bacteria
Other ingredients are added and the cheese is usually aged for a varied length of time
There are many different ways to classify cheeses
Some ways include 
How long the cheese was aged  
The texture of the cheese
These include Hard Soft and Softer 
How the cheese was made 
What type of milk was used to make the cheese
This is mainly what animal the milk comes from such as cows sheep and goats
The diet of the animal can also affect the type of cheese made from its milk 
How much fat is in the cheese 
What color the cheese is common colors are yellow and white  There are also manmade foods that some people use instead of cheese
These are called Cheese analogues
Different types of cheese include     
orbit A comet is a ball of mostly ice that moves around in outer space
Comets are often described as dirty snowballs
They are very different from asteroids
The orbital inclinations of comets are usually high and not near the ecliptic where most solar system objects are found
Most of them are longperiod comets and come from the Kuiper belt
That is very far away from the Sun but some of them also come near enough to Earth for us to see at 
They have long tails because the Sun melts the ice
A comets tail does not trail behind it but points directly away from the Sun because it is blown by the solar wind
The hard centre of the comet is the nucleus
It is one of the blackest things lowest albedo in the solar system
When light shone on the nucleus of Halleys Comet the comet reflected only 4 of the light back to us
Periodic comets visit again and again
Nonperiodic or singleapparition comets visit only once
Comets sometimes break up as Comet Biela did in the 19th century
Comet ShoemakerLevy 9 broke up and the pieces hit Jupiter in 1994
Some comets orbit go around together in groups
Astronomers think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object

Ikeya seki   In old times people used to be scared of comets
They did not know what they were or where they came from
Some thought that they were fireballs sent from demons or gods to destroy the earth
They said that each time a comet appeared it would bring bad luck with it
Whenever a comet appeared a king would die
For example the Bayeux Tapestry shows the return of Halleys Comet and the death of a king
Comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine
During the Renaissance astronomers started to look at comets with less superstition and to base their science on observations
Tycho Brahe reasoned that comets did not come from the earth and his calculations showed that comets must be six times farther than the earth is from the moon
Edmond Halley reasoned that some comets are periodic that is they appear again after a certain number of years and again and again
This led to the first prediction of a comets return Halleys Comet named after him
Isaac Newton also studied comets
He realised that comets make Uturns around the sun
He asked his friend Edmond Halley to publish this in his book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica
Before Newton said this people believed that comets go in to the sun then another comes out from behind the sun
In later years some astronomers thought comets were spit out by planets especially Jupiter
All this new information and research gave people confidence but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods
One 18th century vision said that comets were the places that hell was where souls would ride being burned up by the heat of the sun and frozen by the cold of space
In modern times space probes have visited comets to learn more about them

A circle is a round twodimensional shape
All points on the edge of the circle are at the same distance from the centre
The radius of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side
Mathematicians use the letter r for the length of a circles radius
The  of a circle is the point in the very middle
The diameter meaning all the way across of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre of the circle
Mathematicians use the letter d for the length of this line
The diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius d equals 2 times r
  The circumference meaning all the way around of a circle is the line that goes around the centre of the circle
Mathematicians use the letter C for the length of this line
The number  written as the Greek letter pi is a very useful number
It is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter  equals C divided by d
As a fraction the number  is equal to about   or 335113 which is closer and as a number it is about 31415926535

Hammurabis stele shows him receiving the laws of Babylon from the seated sun deity   The constitution of a country or a state is a special type of law document that tells how its government is supposed to work
It tells how the countrys leaders are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in office how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law what kind of people are allowed to vote and what other rights they are guaranteed and how the constitution can be changed
Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution see Rule of Law 
On the other hand countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others
This can be known as dictatorship or simply bending the rules
A Constitution is often a way of uniting within a Federation
The UKs constitution is not written in one single  like many other countries are
In fact the UKs constitution is not completely written down at all
Some of it can be found in writing starting with the Magna Carta of 1215 and the Bill of Rights Act 1689 and including more modern Acts of Parliament
Other parts of it are considered common law and are made up of the decisions of judges over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or judicial precedence
Because of this some people say that the United Kingdom has a de facto or unwritten constitution
The United States in 1787 began a trend in the writing of constitutions
The United States Constitution is also the shortest that people are still using and it has been changed amended many times over the years
It was made after the colonists won their independence from Britain
At first they had the Articles of Confederation but the Articles were replaced with todays Constitution
The Indian constitution of 1950 is the longest ever written constitution in the world
It  has 448 Articles and 12 Schedules in it with 5 appendices and 98 amendments

Thalia the muse of comedy holding a comic mask  detail of Muses Sarcophagus the nine Muses and their attributes marble early second century AD Via Ostiense  Louvr  Charlie Chaplin a wellknown comedia masks of comedy and traged  Comedy from  in modern times it is a drama which has a generally funny content and are able to make  people laugh
This definition was used for theatre plays and was first used in Ancient Greece
Aristotle defined this as Comedy is as an imitation of characters of a lower type not however in the full sense of the word bad the ludicrous being merely a subdivision of the ugly
It consists in some defect or ugliness which is not painful or destructive
To take an obvious example the comic mask is ugly and distorted but does not imply pain To him the lampooners became writers of Comedy and the truly artistic ones became writers of Tragedy
Comedy is also a media genre that is for television shows or movies that are either funny or silly
People who are known for acting in comedies are termed as comedians or comedic actors
The ancient Greeks had comedies which were presented in competitions at the festival of Dionysia
One of the bestknown comedy authors of the time was Aristophanes about 446386 BC
One of his works The Clouds was performed 425 BC
The work did not survive completely but a later version did survive
It is a satire against Socrates and pictures the great philosopher as a swaggering con artist
Some of the accusations were reused at Socrates trial twenty years later
Typical for satire are that the author criticizes society and living people
Another type of Ancient Greek theatre was the satyr play
This was mock drunkenness brazen sexuality including phallic props pranks sight gags and general merriment
The modern equivalent would be knockabout comedy
Humour or New Comedy is not about criticizing people or ideas but rather about showing characters in funny situations
The most important Greek playwright of this type was probably Menander
The best known Roman comedy writer was Plautus
He often used Greek comedies for his plays
Many comedy plays were written in the 1500s by the British writer William Shakespeare
Shakespeares comedy plays include Alls Well That Ends Well The Comedy of Errors A Midsummer Nights Dream and Twelfth Night
In Shakespeares day a comedy did not mean a play that would make people laugh or that had a lot of jokes
Instead it was a play in which all the problems work out all right in the end
This was unlike a tragedy where the problems do not work out usually resulting in someones death
The two masks one was smiling the other crying often associated with theatre represent comedy and tragedy
There are different types of comedy
One type of comedy is called slap stick comedy
 In slap stick comedy people do silly things such as tripping falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh
Slap stick comedy can be used in comedy movies or comedy television shows
Slap stick comedy was used a lot in silent no sound movies from the 1920s
A comedian who acted in the silent movies who used a lot of slapstick comedy was Charlie Chaplin
In the 1950s and 1960s comedian Jerry Lewis also used silly slap stick comedy in his comedy movies
A comedy is a very popular type of movie
Some comedy movies have slapstick comedy in which people just do silly things such as tripping falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh
Other comedy movies show funny stories or situations in which people are behaving in a silly manner
Some comedies make the audience laugh by showing strange or unusual images or situations that do not make sense
A parody or spoof movie imitates or exaggerates another person or movie to make them seem silly dumb or just plain out of it

A Christian  is a person who believes in Christianity a monotheistic religion
Christianity is mostly about the life and teachings of Jesus Christ in the New Testament and interpreted of prophesied in the Hebrew BibleOld Testament
Christianity is the worlds largest religion with 21 billion followers around the world
Christians consider the Holy Bible to be a sacred book inspired by God
The Holy Bible is a combination of the Hebrew Bible or Torah and a collection of writings called the New Testament
Views on the importance of these writings vary
Some Christian groups prefer to favor the New Testament while others believe the entire Bible is equally important
Also while many Christians prefer to consider the Bible as true inspired by God not all groups believe that it is completely accurate
Some of these groups may think that the Bible is a collection of stories meant to show who God is or even just the opinions of humans that reveal some commonlybelieved truth
The issue of who is a Christian can be very controversial
Christians often disagree over this issue due to their differences in opinion on spiritual matters
It is not possible to provide a statement that all readers may agree with therefore a definition will not be provided
Even very traditional doctrines such as the belief that Jesus Christ is God or that God consists of the Father Son and Spirit are not common to people who claim Christianity as their religion
Many Christians choose to go to church
Most Christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to God and an act of worship
However some Christian groups think that one can be a Christian without ever going to a church
Though there are many different viewpoints on the issue most Protestants believe all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ whether or not those Christians go to an actual church each week
On the other hand Catholics believe that the Holy Catholic Church is the only true church
In some Christian movements especially Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism to be a bornagain Christian is to undergo a spiritual rebirth

Calculus is a branch of mathematics which helps us understand changes between values that are related by a function
For example if you had one formula telling how much money you got every day calculus would help you understand related formulas like how much money you have in total and whether you are getting more money or less than you used to
All these formulas are functions of time and so that is one way to think of calculus  studying functions of time
There are two different types of calculus
Differential calculus divides things into small different pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next while integral calculus joins integrates the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made overall by a series of changes
Calculus is used in many different areas such as physics astronomy biology engineering economics medicine and sociology
In the 1670s and 1680s Sir Isaac Newton in England and Gottfried Leibniz in Germany figured out calculus at the same time working separately from each other
Newton wanted to have a new way to predict where to see planets in the sky because astronomy had always been a popular and useful form of science and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for navigation of ships
Leibniz wanted to measure the space area under a curve a line which is not straight
Many years later the two men argued over who discovered it first
Scientists from England supported Newton but scientists from the rest of Europe supported Leibniz
Most mathematicians today agree that both men share the credit equally
Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton such as its uses in physics
Other parts come from Leibniz such as the symbols used to write it
They were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical world  Aristotle and Pythagoras came earlier and so did Galileo Galilei who said that mathematics was the language of science
But both Newton and Leibniz were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time and can predict how they will change in the future
The name calculus was the Latin word for a small stone the ancient Romans used in counting and gambling
The English word calculate comes from the same Latin word
Differential calculus is the process of finding out the rate of change of a variable compared to another variable
It can be used to find the speed of a moving object or the slope of a curve figure out the maximum or minimum points of a curve or find answers to problems in the electricity and magnetism areas of physics among many other uses
Many amounts can be variables which can change their value unlike numbers such as 5 or 200
Some examples of variables are distance and time
The speed of an object is how far it travels in a particular time
So if a town is 80 kilometres 50 miles away and a person in a car gets there in one hour they have traveled at an average speed of 80 kilometres 50 miles per hour
But this is only an average  they may have been traveling faster at some times on a highway and slower at others at a traffic light or on a small street where people live
Imagine a driver trying to figure out a cars speed using only its odometer distance meter and clock without a speedometer
Until calculus was invented the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time
This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out
tangents to the curve  A very similar problem is to find the  how steep it is at any point on a curve
The slope of a straight line is easy to work out  it is simply how much it goes up y or  divided by how much it goes across x or 
On a curve though the slope is a variable has different values at different points because the line bends
But if the curve was to be cut into very very small pieces the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line
So to work out its slope a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point
If it is done exactly right the straight line will have the same slope as the curve and is called a tangent
But there is no way to know without very complicated mathematics whether the tangent is exactly right and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close
What Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope or the speed in the distance example exactly using simple and logical rules
They divided the curve into an infinite number of very small pieces
They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each
As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in the slope approached a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve
The particular value it approached was the actual slope
Lets say we have a function y  fx f is short for function so this equation means y is a function of x
This tells us that how high y is on the vertical axis depends on what x the horizontal axis is at that time
For example with the equation y  x we know that if x is 1 then y will be 1 if x is 3 then y will be 9 if x is 20 then y will be 400
The derivative produced using this method here is 2x or 2 multiplied by x
So we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve fx  x the derivative fprimex marked with the prime symbol will be 2x at any point
This process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation or finding the derivative
The way to write the derivative in mathematics is   Leibniz came to the same result but called h dx which means with respect to x
He called the resulting change in fx dy which means a tiny amount of y
Leibnizs notation is used by more books because it is easy to understand when the equations become more complicated
In Leibniz notation   Mathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple algebra rules which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function
Integral calculus is the process of calculating the area underneath a graph of a function
An example is calculating the distance a car travels if you know the speed of the car at different points in time and draw a graph of this speed then the distance the car travels will be the area under the graph
The way to do this is to divide the graph into many very small pieces and then draw very thin rectangles under each piece
As the rectangles become thinner and thinner the rectangles cover the area underneath the graph better and better
The area of a rectangle is easy to calculate so we can calculate the total area of all the rectangles
For thinner rectangles this total area value approaches the area underneath the graph
The final value of the area is called the integral of the function
In mathematics the integral of the function fx from a to b is written as 
The main idea in calculus is called the fundamental theorem of calculus
This main idea says that the two calculus processes differential and integral calculus are opposites
That is a person can use differential calculus to undo an integral calculus process
Also a person can use integral calculus to undo a differential calculus method
This is just like using division to undo multiplication or addition to undo subtraction
In a single sentence the fundamental theorem runs something like this The derivative of the integral of a function f is the function itself
Calculus is used to describe things that  like things in nature
It can be used for showing and learning all of these

The last Chinese Civil War 19271949 resulted in two different political powers today even though both governments agree they are one nation 
The Republic of China ROC since 1912  commonly known as China since 1 Jan1912 to 25 Oct1971
Now commonly known as Taiwan has control over the islands of Taiwan Penghu Kinmen and Matsu 
The Peoples Republic of China PRC since 1949 commonly known as China has control over mainland China and the largely selfgoverning territories of Hong Kong since 1997 and Macau since 1999
China has one of the worlds oldest civilizations and has the oldest continuous civilization
It has archaeological evidence over 5000 years old
It also has one of the worlds oldest writing systems and the oldest in use today and is viewed as the source of many major inventions
It is derived from chn a Persian adjective meaning Chinese which was popularized in Europe by Marco Polo
Ancient China was one of the first civilizations and was active since the 2nd millennium BC as a feudal society
Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent writing It reached its golden age during the Tang Dynasty c
AD
10th century
Home of  Confucianism and Daoism it had great influence on nearby countries including Japan Korea and Vietnam in the areas of political system philosophy religion art writing and literature
China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world
Statues and pottery as well as decorations made of jade are some classic examples
Before the Qin Dynasty united China there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control China
This is known as the Warring States Period
Although the continuing wars made people suffer it was at this time when many great philosophies were born including Confucianism and Daoism
Confucianism and Daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern easternAsian cultures today
Its geography mostly looked like that of modern China except with northern and western edges that varied
It was often attacked by northern nomadic people such as the Turkic peoples and the Mongols led by Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan
During the history of ancient China the northern nomadic people and the Chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of China
However when the northern people beat the Chinese people and came to rule the kingdom they also Incorporated the Chinese way of living and became like the Chinese
Many of the strongest dynasties of China were ruled by the northern people including the Qin Tang Yuan Mongolian and Qing
Each time they also brought new elements into the Chinese culture
While China achieved many things in the First millennium and early 2nd millennium it became an isolationist country in the 15th century CE This was because Spain found enormous silver in the new continent which was the main currency money in China and Europe at the time and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners
By the time of the Renaissance European powers started to take over other countries in Asia
While China was never actually taken over many European countries such as Britain and France built spheres of influence in China
Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries by the Qing Dynasty it had fallen behind other countries in technology and was helpless to stop this from happening
This had become clear when it lost the Opium Wars to Britain in the 19th century
Still influenced by Western sources China faced internal strife
The Taiping Rebellion or Taiping War occurred in China from 1851 through 1864
The Taiping Rebellion was led by Hong Xiuquan from Guangdon
Hong Xiuquan was influenced by Christian missionaries and declared himself the brother of Jesus
Hong made his mission to bring down the Qing Dynasty
Gaining influence on the southern Chinese population the Taiping Rebellion attracted tens of thousands of supporters
The Taiping regime successfully created a state within the Qing Empire with the capital at Nanjing
Hong called his new state the Taiping Tianguo or The Heavenly State of Great Peace
Local armies eventually suppressed the rebellion at the final battle of Nanjing
In 1911 the Republic of China was founded by Sun Yatsen but its government was very weak
Warlords controlled many areas
Chiang Kaishek led wars against them and he became President and dictator
In 1931 Japan invaded Manchuria a place in the northeastern part of China
On July 7 1937 the Japanese attacked the rest of the country starting what was called the Second SinoJapanese War
The war later became part of World War II
The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed
However the Chinese Civil War later started between the Kuomintang Nationalists of the Republic of China ROC and the Communists of the Peoples Republic of China PRC
The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time
The Communists were led by Mao Zedong Liu Shaoqi and others
Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved
The Communists eventually won the war
The Nationalists led by Chiang Kaishek fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei
After the Chinese Civil War the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country the Peoples Republic of China PRC in Beijing on October 1 1949
Under Mao the country stayed poor while Taiwan became richer
His attempt at industrialization and collectivization with the Great Leap Forward led to the deaths of many people from famine
The Cultural Revolution caused great social upheaval
After 1976 China underwent market economy reforms under Deng Xiaoping and experienced rapid economic growth
China is now one of the largest economies in the world relying mainly on exports
In recent history China has had problems with protests blocking of information on the Internet and censorship of news
1989 was notable for the controversial Tian An Men Massacre
China is the origin of Eastern martial arts called Kung Fu or its first name Wushu
China is also the home of the wellrespected Spa Monastery and Wudang Mountains
Martial art started more for the purpose of survival defense and warfare than art
Over time some art forms have branched off while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor
China has had renowned artists including Wong Fei Hung Huang Fei Hung or Hwang Fei Hung and many others
Art has also coexisted with a variety of paints including the more standard 18 colors
Legendary and controversial moves like Big Mak are also praised and talked about within the culture
China has many traditional festivals such as Spring Festival Dragon Boat Festival Midautumn Festival and so on
The most important is Chinese New Year
People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals
Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year
Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the Warring States period
He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qins diplomats offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him
He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life
The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse
They made and threw rice dumplings into the river
They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poets corpse
They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish
Such practices eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays
Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month MidAutumn Festival is a festival for families
Now when the festival sets in people would sit together to eat moon cakes appreciate the bright full moon cakes appreciate the bright full moon celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness
To the Chinese people the full moon symbolizes family reunion as does the moon cakes
 Hence the MidAutumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival

A cube is a block with all right angles and whose height width and depth are all the same
A cube is one of the simplest mathematical shapes in space
Something that is shaped like a cube is sometimes referred to as cubic
The basic difference between a cube and a square is a cube is a 3D figure having 3 dimensions ie length breadth and height while a square has only 2 dimensions ie
length and breadth
The 2dimensional 2D shape like a circle square triangle etc that a cube is made of is squares
The sides faces of a cube are squares
The edges are straight lines
The corners vertices are at right angles
A cube has 8 corners 12 edges and 6 faces as in the most usual kind of dice
A tesseract carries this idea into the fourth dimension 4D and is made of 8 cubes
The volume of a cube is the length of any one of the edges they are all the same length so it does not matter which edge is used cubed
This means you multiply the number by itself and then by itself again
If the edge is named d See Diagram the equation would be this Volumeddd or Volumed

Oliver Cromwells visitors leaving a monastery
People think this could be Colchester Abbey after it was ruined  The dissolution of the monasteries was an event that happened from 1536 to 1540 when English King Henry VIII took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the Roman Catholic church owned
Henry VIII then gave this land and money to people that supported him
This was also when Henry VIII made himself the new head of the Church of England which is a type of Christianity
Parliament made the Act of Supremacy to give him the right to do both these things
It was part of the Protestant Reformation in England
A deadline is a time by which some  must be d
Very often it means a time limit that is set in place by an authority  for example a teacher tells students that they must turn in their  in by a certain time
This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her principal that every student had the same chance to do the work
Deadlines may also be set by a time horizon that comes from something that is not a human authority but part of nature
For example by sunset one must do those tasks requiring daylight
However a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself
A way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the physical horizon where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this
A deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things
Dutton Speedwords is a  madeup language written by Reginald John Garfield Dutton
The idea of Dutton Speedwords is to make frequent words short and very frequent words very short
Dutton Speedwords can be used as a second language for international communications
Dutton Speedwords is also a shorthand writing system  this means you can use it to write quickly
The method was made up by Reginald John Garfield Dutton 18861970 in 1922
It was first published in 1935
It was called International Symbolic Script
A year later it was called Speedwords
It was changed in 1946 and 1951
It has two uses to be a language and to be used for writing quickly
Dutton hoped that this would mean more people would learn it because they could use it for two reasons
The books that Dutton wrote about Speedwords are not printed anymore
But Speedwords is now being used by more people because they find it is good for working online
For example it makes it faster to type an email
Another way of writing quickly is Pitmans shorthand
This uses special symbols instead of letters
Speedwords uses Roman letters
This makes it easier to learn
It also means it can be typed using a normal keyboard
Each word means only one thing
This means you do not need to use different forms of the same word
The words used in Speedwords are the same as the words used in many other languages
The words are like short versions of the writers own language

square the cube and the tesseract
The square is a 2dimensional object the cube is a 3dimensional object and the tesseract is a 4dimensional object
A 1dimensional object is just a line
A projection of the cube is given since it is viewed on a twodimensional screen
The same applies to the tesseract which additionally can only be shown as a projection even in threedimensional space   Dimensions are the way we see measure and experience our world 
By Using up and down right to left back to front hot and cold how heavy and how long as well as more advanced concepts from mathematics and physics
One way to define a dimension is to look at the degrees of freedom or the way an object can move in a specific space
There are different concepts or ways where the term dimension is used and there are also different definitions
There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts
In a vector space a vector is an opened ended line a dimension is equal to the  cardinality or number of directions of vectors or lines
It is also equal to the number of the largest group of straight line directions of that space Normal objects in everyday life are specified by three dimensions which are usually called length width and depth
Mathematicians call this concept Euclidean space
Dimensions can be used to measure position too
The distance to a position from a starting place can be measured in the length width and height directions
These distances are a measure of the position
Sometimes a fourth 4D dimension time is used to show the position of an event in time and space
In modern science people use other dimensions
Dimensions like temperature and weight can be used to show the position of something in less simple spaces
Scientist study those dimension with dimensional analysis
Mathematicians also use dimensions
In mathematics dimensions are more general
Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the world
The rules for doing arithmetic with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules
Vectors are used to show distances and directions
Vectors are often used in engineering and science and sometimes in  mathematics
A vector is a list of numbers
There is one number for each dimension
There are arithmetic rules for vectors
For example if Jane wants to know the position of Sally Sally can give Jane a vector to show the position
If Jane and Sally are in the world there are three dimensions
Therefore Sally gives Jane a list of three numbers to show her position
The three numbers in the vector Sally gives Jane might be  Sallys distance north of Jane  Sallys distance east of Jane  Sallys height above Jane   
REDIRECT Dimension 
Distance is how far one thing is from another thing
Distance is a measure of the space between two things
It can be measured along any path
Thus someone who goes around in a circle has traveled a distance even though his position has not changed
Distance is different from displacement
Displacement is a vector that measures distance with a straight line and in only one path
Displacement is the shortest way to travel the distance
One ball is 5 feet from another ball
The distance between the two balls is 5 feet 
John walks at a speed of 6 kilometres per hour for one hour
John walks a distance of 6 kilometres
A circle is a curved line
Each point on the circle is the same distance from the centre of the circle
horns and a tail In some religions the devil is a bad spirit or supernatural being that tries to create problems for people and distance them from God
Some people also use the words the Devil or Satan for the most powerful devil
The word devil comes from the Greek word diabolos which means someone who tells lies to hurt you Diabolos is translated to the English word slanderer The New Testament uses diabolos as a title for Satan and so The Devil became another name for Satan in English
In the Old Testament there is the serpent and the shaitan who may be two different characters Shaitan in Hebrew means adversary an enemy or opponent
Shaitan is also the word used for the devil in the Koran who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing
In Christianity the Devil was originally an angel in heaven called Lucifer
But he wanted to be the ruler of heaven and so he revolted against God
After a hard fight he was defeated and thrown out of heaven
Some other angels who helped him were also thrown out
After the Devil was thrown out of heaven he started doing bad things on the earth
He wants people to worship him instead of God
Sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises
The other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons
They obey the Devil and help him do evil things
The Book of Revelation says that God will punish the Devil and his demons by throwing them into a Lake of Fire that burns in Hell
This will happen in the future
Artists draw pictures of the Devil that show him as ugly and evil
But nobody knows what he may look like
Usually he is a spirit that nobody can see but he can make himself look like a real person in order to trick people
Many modern depictions of the devil portray him as a red humanlike being with horns and a pointed tail carrying a red pitchfork
Not all religions believe in the devil
For example Buddhists do not believe in the devil
Many satanists believe in the devil or Satan only as a metaphor not an actual being or person
Diarrhea DIEuhREEuh also spelled diarrhoea happens when the body makes more watery feces than normal
Diarrhea can occur in humans as well as most other mammals   Diarrhea is not a disease
But it may be a symptom of a disease
The most common causes of diarrhea are 
Viruses like Norovirus the most common cause of viral gastroenteritisstomach fluin humans 
Bacteria like E coli or C diff 
Some medicines especially antibiotics 
Food poisoning 
Lactose intolerance 
Artificial sweeteners like sorbitol and mannitol which are in many sugarfree food products like sugarless gum 
Other problems with the intestines like Crohns disease and irritable bowel syndrome   In developing nations diarrheal diseases are the second most common cause of death in children under age 5
Every year in the world diarrhea kills around 760000 children under age 5
Because diarrhea is watery it takes away a lot of the water
It also takes away electrolytesimportant salts that the body needs to survive
Dehydration is extra dangerous for small children because they have less water in their bodies to begin with
This means they cannot lose as much water as adults before they start to have serious health problems
In developing countries diarrhea is usually caused by an infection in the intestines
These infections can be caused by bacteria viruses or parasites
These infections spread easily in some developing countries because of the following reasons  Some oral rehydration solutions have extra electrolytes like potassium in them also
Some oral rehydration solutions come in packets and just need to be mixed with clean water
Oral rehydration solution can also be made at home
If the water in the area is not safe it can be boiled to make it safe
Boiling the water will kill any bacteria viruses or parasites in the water
  Salt and sugar are then mixed into the water
Drinking this mixture after the water cools will rehydrate the child if he drinks enough
Adding a banana or orange juice can add potassium to the mixture
Breast milk will also rehydrate a child with diarrhea

A definition is an exact word or phrase of the meaning nature or limits of something
A definition usually answers the question what
Defining means giving a definition
Other words with this meaning are  and explanation
It describes what a word means and explains to the person when and where it can be used
In mathematics a definition is an exact way of saying what something is
It might not be the easiest way to say what it is but it is used because it is exact
It can be used in a mathematical proof about the thing
A dieselelectric engine is a diesel generator a diesel engine that drives an electric generator
The generator feeds electric power to an electric motor which turns a driveshaft
Its efficiency is higher than when an engine drives a shaft through gears
Most locomotives and many ships use dieselelectric drive
Many dieselelectric drives especially small ones store the electricity in a battery
Some designs also store braking energy in a flywheel which can also charge a battery
However these add even more complexity and weight to the vehicle so are more appropriate for city driving where service stations are always available and there is much stop and go driving
Because they do not require any change or investment in stations nor much in vehicle design dieselelectric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for todays internal combustion engine
When properly tuned they have low emissions and they use only about onethird of the fossil fuel of most gasoline engines powering similar vehicles
Honda and Toyota are presently delivering consumer priced dieselelectric cars
By contrast hydrogen infrastructure is thought to be decades off and is not fully implemented even in Iceland where there is abundant free geothermal electricity
Many activists feel that promoting hydrogen is a stall a way to avoid forcing the shift to dieselelectric vehicles in the nearer term

Plinys  Naturalis historia from the 13th century
It was first published AD 7779
Pliny died in the eruption of Vesuvius AD 7  An encyclopedia or encyclopdia cyclopdia encyclopaedia is a collection usually a book of information
Some are called encyclopedic dictionaries
All encyclopedias were printed until the late 20th century when some were on CDROM and the Internet
21st century encyclopedias are mostly online by Internet
The largest encyclopedia in the English language is English Wikipedia which has more than 5 million articles
The second largest is the Encyclopaedia Britannica which is the largest one that is printed
Some languages have a larger printed encyclopedia and some have none
Either kind of encyclopedia can inform us on many different topics
Book series were used to summarize all knowledge have been published for thousands of years
A famous early one was the Natural Historyby Pliny the Elder
The name encyclopedia is from the 16th century and meant complete knowledge
The French Encyclopdie of Denis Diderot was the first that had major parts written by many different people
After the printing press was invented dictionaries with long definitions began to be called encyclopedias
For example a dictionary of science if it included essays was thought of as an encyclopedia or knowledgeable book on the subject of science
Some encyclopedias then put essays on more than one subject in alphabetical order instead of grouping them together by subject
The word encyclopedia was put in the title of some encyclopedias
Companies such as Britannica were started for the purpose of publishing encyclopedias for sale to individuals and for public use in libraries
Like dictionaries these publishers hired hundreds of experts to write articles and read and choose articles
Some internet encyclopedias allowed their paying customers to submit articles
Other internet encyclopedias accepted writing from nonpaying users of the encyclopedia
There are different types of encyclopedias
Some are general and have pages on lots of topics
The English language Encyclopdia Britannica and German Brockhaus are general encyclopedias
Some are about specific topics
For example there are encyclopedias of medicine or philosophy
Others include the Dictionary of National Biography the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships and Blacks Law Dictionary
There are also encyclopedias that that cover many topics with one  or one cultural bias
They include the Great Soviet Encyclopedia and Conservapedia
There are two main ways of organizing printed encyclopedias from A to Z the alphabetical way or by categories
Most encyclopedias go from A to Z
Many dictionaries have similar information to encyclopedias

Europe is surrounded by water on three sides
On the west is the Atlantic Ocean
To the north is the Arctic Ocean
The Mediterranean Sea separates Southeastern Europe from Africa
There are more than 50 countries in Europe
Most of these countries are members of the European Union
Europe covers about 10180000 square kilometres  3930000 square miles

Europe contains the worlds second most active volcano
Greenland in Europe Is the worlds biggest island  considering Australia is a continent  Europe is a major tourist attraction
People come from all over the world to see its many World Heritage Sites and other attractions
Europe is named after a princess in Greek mythology called Europa
 The myth says that Zeus kidnapped Europa and took her to Crete where she became the mother of King Minos whom Europes first civilisation derives its name the Minoans from
The name Europa was later used to describe Greece
Then as the rest of modernday
Europe started to have cities and empires the entire area West of the Ural Mountains came to be called Europa
    Main article History of Europe  The history of Europe is long and has many turns
Many great countries originated from Europe
Greek mythology and the beginning of western civilization came from European nations
Some of the major periods in European history have been  
Ancient Greek Civilisation Minoan Mycenaean Classical Hellenistic c1750 BC to 146 BC 
Roman Civilisation Roman kingdom Roman Republic and Roman Empire 753BC476 
Medieval Civilisation Early High Late 476 to 1492 
Early Modern Era Renaissance Reformation Age of Discovery Enlightenment 14921789 
19th Century 20th Century and 21st Century French Revolution Napeoleonic Wars Industrial Revolution Colonialism World War 1 World War 2 Cold War 1789present   Andreas M Kaplan describes modern Europe as a continent where many different cultures live closely together embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances
There are several major regions of Europe 
Eastern Europe 
Central Europe 
Western Europe 
Northern Europe 
Southern and Southeastern Europe Within these regions there are more than 50 independent European countries
The largest is the Russian Federation which covers 39 of Europe
The European city with the largest population is Istanbul
The country with the largest population is the Russian Federation
About 15 of Europeans live in Russia
Two European countries the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are on islands called the British Isles
Most of Europe lies in temperateclimate zones
However there are many different climates throughout Europe
For example during the winter it may be snowing and 30 degrees Celsius for 45 months in Finland
Yet it may be much warmer with no snow at all except on high mountains in Spain
Main article European Union  The European Union is a confederationof 28 European countries
These countries agree to follow common laws so that their citizens can move and trade in EU countries almost the same as they do in their own
Nineteen of these countries also share the same type ofmoney theeuro

skull is often used as a symbol for deat Death is the end of life in an organism
All biological and living activity of the living thing stop including the mind and the senses
The usual signal for death is that the heart stops beating and cannot be restarted
This can be caused by many things
All living things have a limited lifespan and all living things eventually die
Living things which have died are normally described as being dead
Death of humans is often investigated for the cause in case of crime such as murder accident or disease that may continue to kill other humans
About 150000 people die every day around the world
About two thirds of these people die because of age
In Buddhism reincarnation is believed to occur
Reincarnation is an idea taken from Hinduism
Confucianism advises respect for parents and forms of ancestor worship to respect both dead and living ancestors
Every ethical tradition including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death
Often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual
For instance one may say that organ transplant is like cannibalism
Very much of what happens at a human death is ritual
People who wish theirs to be dealt with a certain way and who wish a particular treatment like cremation of their body should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements
This makes it much easier for their family after they die since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish
For the same reason saying goodbye is important
Most of the  of death seems to come for loved ones who did not have a chance to say goodbye
Maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience a person can no longer communicate for themselves can be exchanged by others
Some ritual such as seances claim to allow people to speak to the dead
This is not claimed to be very reliable both by scientists and even by those who do them very often
Aside from wills goodbyes organ donations and funerals there is important personal experience to decide to pass on or not when someone knows they may soon die
Palliative care focuses on basic decisions people make when they are very close to the end of their lives and it ensures someone is always available to talk to them
It is a replacement for heroic medical intervention that may keep them physically alive but with no quality of life
Human psychology must prepare for death if it is anything other than a quick surprise  Elizabeth KublerRoss wrote that there were several stages in dying of which denial was the first and acceptance was the last
Recording ones life is often something people with acceptance will do to leave a memoir or a full autobiography  Because events leave living memory and may only be part of oral tradition there are projects to record everything that people remember about World War I and the Shoah
The first of these was to record everything remembered about the US Civil War
This discipline has changed history since we have so many more first person accounts of the times and made social history much more standard
There are other terms for death
Examples are to pass away to go to a better place to buy the farm generally used in the military to leave the earth big sleep and to kick the bucket
the term gone may also be a term for describing death for example if a person has died they are also said to be gone as in gone to a better place or no longer here
Old age is not the only thing that can end a persons life
People make other people die
This is called killing or murder
Two famous murders are John Wilkes Booth killing Abraham Lincoln and James Earl Ray killing Martin Luther King Jr People can also die by accidents resulting in terminal trauma hypothermia starvation and dehydration

The population of Cuba is close to 13 million
The people of Cuba come from three different groups
The largest group is the descendants of the Spanish settlers who came to Cuba
The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work and birth children in the barracoon as New World slaves who could be legally sold into life time bondage in the United States
The middlesized group is a mix of African and Spanish
The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same
According to a DNA Caribbean Studies Institute the racialmakeup of the population of Cuba is  
European Cubans descend from settlers that came during the very late 15th century and onward
Most white Cubans came from many different parts of Spain but the most numerous were the Canary Islanders Andalusians and Catalans
There was as well some French Italian and English peoples
Whites makeup approximately 30 of Cubas population as of 2012 and they mostly populate the west part of Cuba specially cities like Havana and Pinar del Rio
These brought with them their language religions music and others
Africans and Mulatto Cubans descend from the arrival of African slaves that came from various parts of Africa but the most numerous were West Africans
There were also more than 500000 Haitians that came to Cuba during the Haitian Revolution days
Most Cuban slaves tended to come from the Kongo and Yoruba tribes there were also the Igbos Ewes Fons Fulas Mandinkas and some others
AfroCubans range enormously from 339 percent to 70 percent of the population and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of Cuba
These brought with them their instruments reigion Santeria and customs to the Cuban culture
Mediterranean Cubans are about 3 of the population however one must know that a lot of the Southern Spaniard Cuban descendants have good portion of Moor blood in their family lines due to the close proximate Spain is to North Africa
Many Mediterranean Cubans came during the 1820s1880s and sometimes onward
These are most concentrated in the East specially cities like Guantanamo Bay
They brought much of their foods and cuisines to Cuba and a few vocabularies
Cuba is a developing country and is often depicted as a very poor country
In some aspects however like education health care and life expectancy it ranks much better than most countries in Latin America
Its infant death rate is lower than some developed countries
The average life expectancy is 78 years
Cuba has a 998 literacy rate
In 2006 the World Food Programme certified Cuba to be the only country in this region without undernourished children
In the same year the United Nations said that Cuba was the only nation in the world that met the World Wide Fund for Natures definition of sustainable development
Cuba is the largest island in the West Indies
It has many resources
Only about onefourth of the land is mountains or hills
Much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle
Cuba has fertile soil and a warm climate that makes it great for growing crops
Sugar is the most important crop of Cuba and they may get it from the sugar cane
Sugar cane is the largest cash crop grown in Cuba and it brings in most of the money
After that the second is tobacco
Tobacco is made into cigars by hand
A handmade cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world
Other important crops are rice coffee and fruit
Cuba also has many minerals
Cobalt nickel iron copper and manganese are all on the island
Salt petroleum and natural gas are there too
The coast of Cuba has many bays and a few good harbors
Havana which is the capital is also a port
Other harbors have port cities
Nuevitas is a port city on the north coast
Cienfuegos Guantnamo and Santiago de Cubaare some of the port cities on the south coast
Cuba has a semitropical climate
That means that the cool ocean winds keep it becoming hot despite its being in the tropiocal zone
Cuba has a wet season and a dry season
The dry season is from November to April and the wet season is from May to October
August to October is also the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean
Because of this most of Cubas port cities can be flooded along the coast also found in Cuba is the SMA assosiation lead by parthiv

Ancient Egyptian dancing girls and musician Zulu even  Astaire in 192  Dance is a performing art
It is described in many ways
It is when people move to a musical rhythm
They may be alone or in a group
The dance may be an informal play a part of a ritual or a  part of a professional performance
There are many kinds of dances and every human society has its own dances
Dancing is not a sport though it does have some athletic aspects
Dance is an art
Some people dance to express their feelings and emotions
Other people dance to feel better
Dance can be used to tell a story
In some societies dance goes with song as well as music
People who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools
It may take years of practice to become an experienced and flexible dancer
To plan a dance is called choreography done by a choreographer
Often this goes with music and fits into a certain style
Dances may be planned in detail or they may be whatever dancers feel like doing
However most dancing does follow some general style or pattern
One style is the couple dance where usually a man and a woman dance together
Other dances need an ensemble a group of people together to make it work
People have always danced
Every society has its own dances
There are pictures on pottery and stone which show dances from several thousand years ago in Egypt and Greece
The image dances according to Sachs are to do with the world outside the dancer
By imitating an animal or object the dancer believes he can capture a power and make it useful
To dance in imitation of the animal which is going to be hunted is to become one with them
To imitate the act of sex is to achieve fertility
This is the kind of thinking behind an image dance
Sachs points out that societies of this kind do not really understand the connection between cause and effect
They really believe the image dances work
The dance type which is used in image dances is mime
The two styles of dance may be joined together
Fertility dances may involve both ecstatic states and mime
The great dancer Nijinsky used some of these ideas in his choreography for the ballet Le Sacre du Printemps The Rite of Spring a ballet about the sacrifice of a girl during a primitive celebration of Spring
In more recent times the first dance school we know about was opened in 1661 in Paris
Only men were accepted until 1681
After 1681 women were accepted too
Ballroom dances are forms of modern dance
Ballroom dances such as the waltz are done by couples
Until the 20th century most ballroom dances were sequence dances
The way people moved was planned in set formation
These formations were usually lines or squares
Everyone moved at the same time and finished at the same time
The music played for a set time and then stopped
After the invention of the waltz around 1800 another style of dancing developed
In the waltz and later dances people danced in couples but they did so separately
They did not dance in formation but moved round the room as they pleased but anticlockwise
Often new dance styles arrive
Some dance as individuals separately as they please
Street dance is like that
All these types of dance have music
At the same time round the world there are many traditional dances
Some of them have been going for hundreds of years
We call them folkloric dances
The coming of popular music videos and DVDs led to a kind of dancer previously seen in some stage shows
A backup dancer or background dancer  is a performer who dances with or behind the lead performers in a live musical act or in a music video
There are many different styles of dance which fall into these general types

Et cetera means and the rest in Latin
It is often used in English to continue a list that is longer than what can be normally written
People most often write et cetera as etc
Very rarely it is also written c because the  or the  is the same as et having been formed by  e and t being joined into a single letter
It is also the symbol for and
Some people write it as ect but that is wrong since it incorrectly abbreviates et cetera

An experiment is a test of an idea or a 
It is often used by scientists and engineers
An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world
Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them
Experiments are part of scientific method
Many experiments are controlled experiment  Now a hundred years or so after Einstein published his ideas there have been many tests all of which have been consistent with Einsteins predictions
But one day we might find the theory has some limits beyond which it does not work
What we test are implications of the theory because the theory itself is too large and complicated to test all at once

Ethics is the part of philosophy that deals with good and evil
Ethics tries to answer questions like  
What actions are good
What actions are evil 
How can we tell the difference 
Are good and evil the same 
How should we make hard decisions that might help or hurt other people 
How do our actions affect others
When discussing ethics the philosophy is generally separated into 
thinking about morality 
the involvement of science  
the freedom of people to decide for themselves how to act within their own beliefs
Morality is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad
There are many different moralities but they share some things
For example most people think that murder killing somebody is wrongcompare Exodus 20
13 Some philosophers have hope to find more things that moralities share
They think that ethics should use the scientific method to study  things that people think are good or bad
Their work can be used to test the fairness of a situation such as how people should treat each other
An example of this kind of thinking is the categorical imperative
Many countries have laws based on this idea of fairness
Understanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices
Many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics
Ethics is part of other fields of study in many ways
Here are some ways  
Ethics is part of the study of religion
In religion people often learn what is good or bad from what they believe about God or gods
Some important ideas about what is good or bad have come from religion
See Ten Commandments 
Some theories of economics say ethics has to do with money
Money is a big part of most peoples lives
Thinking about morality can be important in economics
For example there is a saying about ethics taken from the Bible that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil 1 TimothyThe philosophy of Marxism also says that a few people using money in the wrong way can hurt many other people 
Government policy can be affected by what politicians think is ethical
Politicians try to create laws that help everyone do what is right
Political debates happen when the people who make public policy do not agree about what is right 
In work thinking about ethics can help with hard questions
Work can be like both economics and politics
Workers have to make money and follow laws
But the best way to do both is not always easy to know
The study of this is called business ethics 
People like doctors and nurses have to make  choices about how to care for people
Sometimes the person being cared for their family or the doctor do not agree what is best for them
Also choices have to be made if there are enough resources to help all
The study of this is called medical ethics
Similar studies for specific professions include bioethics and legal ethics 
Discussing ethics can also be a way to stop people fighting or starting a war
By talking about ethics people hope to get what they want without being violent
This works when all people agree that peace is very important
But not everyone agrees about what is right or wrong
So sometimes anger can make it hard to talk without fighting
Along with aesthetics ethics forms part of axiology the philosophy of what people like
Conflict of interest 
Utilitarianism 
The Republic a book by Plato that says that people who have power should use ethics to make choices 
The Prince a book by Niccol Machiavelli that says that people who have power should not use ethics to make choices
E Prime it means English Prime is a way of speaking English without using the verb to be in any way be is am are was were been and being
Instead an E Prime speaker or writer uses different verbs like to become to remain and to equal or they might choose to rearrange the sentence to show that the thing does not actually act
For example in E Prime a writer would change the statement Mistakes were made to Joe made mistakes
 This change in wording reveals an actor Joe where the previous form concealed the actor
Users of E Prime would consider the changed sentence more accurate
D
David Bourland Jr first suggested E Prime in 1965
Bourland had studied the discipline way of thinking of General Semantics
The main idea of General Semantics is that people can only know what they observe and experience when they see hear touch taste smell think and feel and furthermore that what they observe and experience can affect how they observe and experience in the future
Because each person has different experiences throughout their lives they interpret their experiences differently
Students of General Semantics and users of E Prime contend that to say This cat is soft leaves out many other attributes and implies that the outside object of the cat is the same as the inside experience of softness
Instead E Prime users say This cat feels soft TO ME to remind themselves of the following That their experience of softness involves both the outside object called cat and the eyes hands brain and nervous system of the observer  That someone else might experience different aspects of the cat  That they themselves might experience something different at a different time or in different circumstances The cat might scratch them or look or feel wet or matted with dirt
   Although languages like Russian Arabic Turkish and Cantonese do not always use a separate verb for to be they do have the idea of being
 For example an English speaker might say This apple is red
 An Arabic speaker might say This apple red
 Most languages can be used to express the idea of a red apple
An E Prime user chooses to say This apple looks red to me to remind themselves that seeing red involves both the apple and the eye and brain of the person looking at the apple
Many teachers of English encourage students to use verbs other than to be
 To them using more active verbs makes writing clearer and more interesting
These teachers want to improve their students writing and may not agree with the ideas of General Semantics or E Prime
In English to be can have different functions It talks about Identity The cat is my only pet The cat is Garfield It talks about belonging to a class or a group The cat is an animal It can talk about properties The cat is furry It can be an auxiliary verb The cat is sleeping The cat is bitten by the dog It can talk about existence There is a cat It can talk about location The cat is here

An ethnic group is a group of people who are considered to be the same in some or multiple ways
They may all have the same ancestors speak the same language or have the same religion
They often live in the same or surrounding area
Sometimes almost all of the people in one country are of the same ethnic group but not always
Often one country may have several different ethnic groups or the people of one ethnic group may live in several different countries
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ensures the rights of ethnic groups in Article 27 and also gives them the right to use their own language

Einstein on the Beach is an opera written by the minimalist composer Philip Glass and theater director and designer Robert Wilson
It was first acted for an audience in Avignon France in 1976
It is a single act opera about five hours long with no intermission
Because of the length and the minimalist repetitive nature of the music audience members are free to enter and leave the opera as they wish
Glasss music tends to cycle round but does not exactly repeat itself
Admittedly he has described himself as a composer of music with repetitive structures
Though his earlier music fits what is normally called minimalist he has since evolved stylistically
volcano eruption is the release of stored energy from below the surface of Earth
The heat comes mostly from radioactive decay and convection in the Earths core and mantle Earth science is an allembracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth
Earth science may also be called geoscience
It is a broader term than geology because it includes aspects of planetary science which is part of astronomy
The Earth sciences include the study of the atmosphere oceans and biosphere as well as the solid earth
Typically Earth scientists will use tools from physics chemistry biology chronology and mathematics to understand the Earth and how it evolved to its current state
If there is one fact which underlies all Earth science it is this the Earth is an ancient planet which has been changing the whole time since its formation
The extent of the changes is much greater than people used to think
OrdovicianSilurian boundary an example of marine transgression as exposed on the Southern tip of the Hovedya island Norway
Due to the folding of the Caledonian mountain range the layers have been inverted leaving Ordovician granular limestone on top of the later Silurian brownish mudstone The following disciplines are generally recognised as being within the geosciences 
Geology describes the rocky parts of the Earths crust or lithosphere and its historic development
Major subdisciplines are mineralogy and petrology geochemistry geomorphology paleontology stratigraphy structural geology engineering geology and sedimentology 
Geophysics and Geodesy investigate the shape of the Earth its reaction to forces and its magnetic and gravity fields
Geophysicists explore the Earths core and mantle as well as the tectonic and seismic activity of the lithosphere 
Soil science covers the outermost layer of the Earths crust that is subject to soil formation processes or pedosphere 
Oceanography and hydrology includes limnology describe the marine and freshwater domains of the watery parts of the Earth or hydrosphere
Includes Marine biology 
Glaciology covers the icy parts of the Earth or cryosphere 
Atmospheric sciences cover the gaseous parts of the Earth or atmosphere between the surface and the exosphere about 1000km
Major subdisciplines are meteorology climatology atmospheric chemistry and physics 
Astronomy includes the study of distant stars and galaxies to the examination of the 46 billion years old Earth from an astronomical point of view
It is also closely related with the study of the solar system and its planets a subdiscipline called planetology
A more distant relative of astronomy is physical cosmology which aims to study the Universe as a whole

Ecology is the science that  studies the biota living things the environment and their interactions
It comes from the Greek oikos  house logos  study
Ecology is the study of ecosystems
Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization
Since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the Earths atmosphere
Scientists who study these interactions are called ecologists
Terrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists now focus
There are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology wetland management natural resource management agriculture forestry fisheries city planning urban ecology community health economics and applied science
It provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction
Ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements  including the conservation movement wellness movement environmental movement and ecology movement we know today
When these are combined with peace movements and the Six Principles they are called green movements
In general these put ecosystem health first on a list of human moral and political priorities as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony and better economics
People with these beliefs are called political ecologists
Some have organized into the Green Parties but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties
They very often use arguments from ecology to advance policy especially forest policy and energy policy
Also ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment including other organisms
Many ecologists also deal with human economics  
Lynn Margulis says that economics studies how humans make a living while ecology studies how every other animal makes a living 
Mike Nickerson says that economy is threefifths of ecology since ecosystems create resources and dispose of waste which the economy assumes is done for free
Ecological economics and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others but it is difficult
Many people think economics is just part of ecology now and that economics that ignores it is wrong Natural capital is an example of one theory combining both
Sometimes ecology is compared to anthropology
Anthropology includes how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment while ecology includes how our environment is affected by our bodies and minds
There is even a type of anthropology called ecological anthropology which studies how people interact with the environment
Antoine de SaintExupery stated The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books

Everything2 or E2 is a website
It lets people make pages about many different things and some people use it as a diary
E2 users create pages called nodes and add stuff in writeups
Only loggedin users can create writeups
Only the person who created the writeup or someone who the website owners called gods choose can edit the writeup
On the other hand on Wikipedia anyone can edit pages but on Everything2 only those who can edit the writeup can edit pages
Everything2 does not require a  like Wikipedia does
So it is possible to have more than one article writeups under the same title node each by different authors and presenting different points of view
     MeshID          D019142  Ebola virus is a very dangerous virus
It belongs to the Filoviridae family and is responsible for a severe disease characterized by the sudden onset of hemorrhagic fever accompanied by other nonspecific signs and symptoms
Hemorrhagic means that the victim will bleed a lot inside and outside their body
The virus attacks almost every organ and tissue of the human body resulting in multiorgan dysfunction
Out of every 10 people who get Ebola on average five to nine die
There are four kinds of Ebola virus that can cause the disease
The virus was first found in Sudan
It is found in Africa with very few cases in Europe and the United States
The Ebola virus that makes people sick lives in the blood and other liquids and wet things in some kinds of nonhuman animals without killing them
Scientists think the animals it lives in are mainly some kinds of monkeys or fruit bats
When people touch animals that have the virus or wet things that came out of those animals they can get sick
Ebola cannot be caught through the air or by being near sick people
The virus can only go from liquids into peoples bodies
This means Ebola can be caught by touching a sick persons blood saliva mucus semen diarrhea vomit or other fluids that come out of a sick persons body
If a person does not die from the disease he can still give other people the infection by having sex for nearly another two months after they stop being sick
This is because the virus can still be in the mans semen after a long time
1
Once the virus enters the human body via mucosal surfaces abrasions or injuries in the skin or by direct parental transmission it fuses with the cells lining the respiratory tract eyes or body cavities
2
It invades the macrophages and dendritic immune cells and releases its genetic content
The cell explosion triggers the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines initiating a cytokine storm
The genetic material takes over the cell machinery to replicate itself new copies of the virus are formed and released into the system
3
The virus then goes on to attack spleen kidneys and even the brain
The blood vessels leak blood and fluid into the surrounding tissues
This atypical clotting and bleeding at the same time manifests externally in the form of rashes
4
The virus causes the shutdown of other vital organs such as liver and lungs too
In fact it is able to invade almost all human cells through different attachment mechanisms for each cell type except for lymphocytes
The very cells that are meant to fight infection are used as carriers to spread infection to other body parts  5
It has been found that the ebolainfected cells do not undergo normal apoptosis but exhibit vacuolization and signs of necrosis
When people get Ebola the first symptoms look like some other diseases
People get a fever and feel very tired
Their head stomach joints and throat might hurt
Sometimes people think they have other diseases like malaria or typhoid fever
Later people get much sicker
They bleed both inside and outside their bodies
They have blood in their diarrhea and vomit
They bleed from their noses mouths and genitalssex organs
They get shock low blood pressure fast pulse heart rate and low blood circulation to the body
Their organs might stop working
Ebola also causes stiffness throughout the body which makes it hard for sick people to move
Five to nine out of every ten people who get sick with Ebola die
There is no cure for Ebola but if people get care quickly from doctors and nurses at a hospital more of them live
People with Ebola need a lot of fluids to replace fluids lost from diarrhea vomiting and bleeding
The most important care is giving them water with a very small amount of salt and sugar in it
This is called oral rehydration
It helps to replace their fluids and blood
It is also important to give medicines in case they get bad blood pressure and blood circulation
In December 2016 a study found the VSVEBOV vaccine to be very effective in the neighborhood of 70100 against the Ebola virus making it the first vaccine against the disease
Many Ebola vaccine candidates had been developed in the decade prior to 2014 but as of October 2014 none had yet been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA for use in humans

Ecological yield is the harvestable growth of an ecosystem
It is most commonly measured in forestry  in fact sustainable forestry is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year within a given patch of forest
However the concept is also applicable to water and soil and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed  the socalled renewable resources
The carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is renewed refreshed or regrown or rebuilt
The experience economy is the  service economy that customers experience directly
In moral purchasing Natural Capitalism and other theories of how consumers make choices they are actually choosing experiences or comprehensive outcomes of their choices
For instance to buy local is to choose a whole experience of local suppliers such as in a farmers market or Slow Food that is quite different than the experience associated with factory food or fast food

sulphur has a crystalline structur Bromine is one of only two elements that are liquid at 25C
The other is Mercury and the others can only be made in laboratories
The human body is made up of 26 elements
The first manmade element was technetium in 1937
Chemical elements are commonly arranged in the periodic table
Where the elements are on the table tells us about their properties relative to the other elements
Chemical elements are also given a unique chemical symbol
Chemical symbols are used all over the world
This means that no matter which language is spoken there is no confusion about what the symbol means Au is the symbol for gold and it comes from the Latin word for gold aurum
Another symbol which comes from Latin is Ag
This is the element silver and it comes from the Latin argentum
An isotope is a form of an element with a certain number of neutrons
For example carbon has two stable naturally occurring isotopes carbon12 6 neutrons and carbon13 7 neutrons
Carbon14 8 neutrons is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of carbon
Of each element except for Ununoctium at least two isotopes are known
Elements can be classified based on physical states
At room temperature and pressure most elements are solids only 11 are gases and 2 are liquids
Elements can also be classified into metals and nonmetals
There are many more metals than nonmetals
However a few elements have properties in between those of metals and nonmetals
These elements are called semimetals or metalloids

Economics is the branch of knowledge concerned with the production consumption and transfer of wealth
The subjects actors in economic study are households business companies the government the state and foreign countries
Households offer their factors of production to companies
This includes work land capital machines buildings and information
They get income which they use to buy or consume goods
Business companies produce and sell goods and services and buy factors of production from households and from other companies
The state or public sector includes institutions and organisations
The state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households and uses it to pay for public goods like streets or education to be available for everyone
The last subject is foreign countries
This includes all households business companies and state institutions which are not based in ones own country
They demand and supply goods from abroad
The objects things acted upon in economic study are consumer goods capital goods and factors of production
Consumer goods are classified as usage goods for example gasoline or toilet paper as purpose goods for example a house or bicycle and as services for example the work of a doctor or cleaning lady
Capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods
Examples of these are buildings equipment and machines
Factors of production are work ground capital information and environment
All people have to decide between their options 
The cost of goods is what a person gives up for the goods 
When a person gives up something like money to get a good they also give up other things that they could have gotten instead
This means that the true cost of something is what you give up to get it
This includes money and the economic benefits utility that you didnt get because you can no longer buy something elseThis is called opportunity cost 
People react to encouragements incentives
Making an option more attractive will make more people choose it 
Trade can make everyone better off 
Markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life
In the free market goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions
The invisible hand of the market Adam Smith states that if everyone tries to get what they want everyone will be as welloff as they could possibly be 
Sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society
For example air pollution is bad for society and education is good for society
The government can put a tax or do something to reduce sales on items that are bad for society
It can also support like giving money for items that are good for society 
The living standard of a country depends on the skills to produce services and goods
Productivity is the amount of the produced goods divided by total working hours
When there is an increase in the total money supply or when the cost to produce things rises prices go up
This is called inflation

Physiocracy 
Classical economics 
Marxist economics 
Austrian economics 
Neoclassical economics 
Welfare economics  Economists are strongly influenced by the times they live in
For example Karl Marx lived in a time where workers conditions were very poor and John Maynard Keynes lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s
Todays economists can look back and understand why they made their judgments and try to make better ones
The two main branches of economics are microeconomics and macroeconomics
Macroeconomics is about the economy in general
For example if a countrys wealth goes up or if millions of people become unemployed those are things that macroeconomists study
Microeconomics is about smaller and more specific things such as how families and households spend their money or how a business operates
There are a number of other branches of economics 
Behavioral economics

A dictionary is a book which explains the meanings of words or more precisely lexemes
The words are arranged in alphabetical order so that they can be found quickly
The word dictionary comes from the Latin dictio saying
There are several types of dictionaries dictionaries which explain words and how they are used dictionaries which translate words from one language to another dictionaries of biography which tell about famous people technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular subject sometimes called a thesaurus
Some of these come close to being an encyclopedia but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things knowledge and does not explain the use of the language
An encyclopedic dictionary gives less information about the topic than a real encyclopedia does but more than a simple dictionary
Dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear definition of the word eg
hippopotamus  a hoofed mammal with thick skin large mouth and short legs that lives in rivers and lakes of Africa
   A big dictionary will also give more information about the word
It will explain how it is pronounced
Usually the International Phonetic Alphabet is used for this
It will explain how the word is used
This is not a problem for a word like hippopotamus but a word like put has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole page or more to explain how it can be used
It will also explain the origin of the word eg
Greek hippos horse and potamus river
A dictionary may also give the form of the word in different tenses plural form etc   There are also dictionaries which translate words into foreign languages
Very often one volume one book will translate both ways for example half the book might be translating from English to Dutch and the other half from Dutch to English
When using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language one has to be careful to choose the right word
A word like right has two basic meanings in English 1 correct and 2 the opposite of left
Other languages  have different words for these different meanings but they have homonyms of their own
A word like put has many meanings
A good dictionary will have a large list of these meanings to help people find the word they want
In many languages for example the word put will be different according to whether something is being put onto something eg
a table or into something eg
a cupboard
Dictionaries need to be updated frequently because of the way language changes
New words are often brought into a language eg lots of computer terms or words change their meanings eg gay or cool
The most famous English Dictionary is the Oxford English Dictionary or OED
Words are always being added to the OED
They are never taken out even if they are obsolete not used any more
The OED can be accessed online with a subscription
Wikimedia the same group that runs Wikipedia has an online dictionary that can be updated by anyone at any time
It is called Wiktionary and it exists in many languages just like Wikipedia

The Flesch Reading Ease test says how easy something is to read
Tools to calculate the Flesch Reading Ease include  
Microsoft Words grammar check 
Abiword open source 
KWord open source 
The Flesch Reading Ease Scale measures readability as follows  100 Very easy to read
Average sentence length is 12 words or fewer
No words of more than two syllables
65 Plain English
Average sentence is 15 to 20 words long
Average word has two syllables
30 A little hard to read
Sentences will have mostly 25 words
Two syllables usually
0 Very hard to read
Average sentence is 37 words long
Average word has more than two syllables
The higher the rating the easier the text is to understand
By the very nature of technical subject matter the Flesch score is usually relatively low for technical documentation
If the Flesch test is used regularly one may develop a sense of what a reasonable score is for the type of documentation one is working on and aim to align with this score
The approach to calculating the Flesch score is as follows   Calculate the average sentence length L
 Calculate the average number of syllables per word N
 Calculate score between 0100
The Flesch score for this subsection is 61

If someone is found guilty of a crime their punishment may be to pay a fine a certain amount of money
In many countries fines can be ordered by police court judges and some government officers
When agreeing to a contract with a business a customer may agree to certain rules
If the customer breaks the rules then they agree to pay a fine for doing so
For example when somebody hires a car and agrees to return it by Friday they agree that if they do not return the car by Friday they must pay a 50 fine to the business
Financial capital is a form of capital
It is things that have value but do not do anything by themselves
They are only valuable because people value want them
For example money is a form of financial capital
You cannot do anything with money but it still has value
Financial capital is used to pay for things this is because there is always more of it and people always want it
This means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people
Some forms of financial capital such as stocks gold or bonds are not wanted by everybody
However they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital
Because of this these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price
This means that some people try to make a profit by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a market
Some things are treated as financial capital even though they do have a use
For example some people buy and sell land but are not interested in doing anything with it
Some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money
Other types of capital such as social capital and human capital are rarely treated like financial capital
This may be because they involve people
Treating useful capital like financial capital is called comodification
In politics a common question is how often the government should use financial capital
In particular should the government use financial capital to make a profit
Traditionally liberal politicians do not mind this kind of trading for profit but socialist or conservative politicians are against it

Execution is where state authorities kill someone for having committed an extremely serious crime usually treason or especially terrible murders
In most countries where the death penalty is still provided for by law using it is an option available to the sentencing judge even if the jury or judicial panel recommends the death penalty the presiding judge still has the option to lock the convicted person in a prison for the rest of their life
Lady Jane Grey a probably innocent Queen of England is beheaded Beheading means cutting the convicts head off
It is one of the oldest execution methods and already mentioned in the Bible
Beheading used to be the standard method of execution in Scandinavia and Germany
Commoners were usually beheaded with an axe and noblemen with a sword
A special device like guillotine can also be used as in France
Nazi Germany used guillotine to execute criminal convicts such as murderers
Centuries ago many countries used beheading as an execution for important people including England
In England many noblemen and even some kings and queens have been beheaded
There the prisoner would be led up the scaffold and usually say a speech
Then heshe would be blindfolded and put hisher neck onto a block
Then the executioner would lift up his axe and swing it down onto the victims neck
If the executioner was skilled and the axe was sharp then the axe would usually cut through the bone and organs of the victim in one stroke
But if the executioner was inexperienced then it may take many strokes before the head would be cut off
Edouard Manet
It shows a firing squad Many countries do not allow executions as punishment any more because it is too violent
However many states of the United States and some other foreign countries allow it
Even in the United States less violent ways of execution have had to be used
Here are some other ways of execution other than hanging  
Lethal injection  Killing a person by placing several poisons in their blood
This is used as the choice of execution in most US states that allow executions 
Gas chamber A person is placed in area where the air is filled with bad gases until he cannot breathe and dies
This was used as an execution method in some US states and by the Nazis during the Holocaust 
Electrocution Killing a person by placing them in an electric chair and giving them a very high electric shock 
Firing Squad  Several people shoot and kill a person
This execution was used in the state of Utah until recently and was also often used in the United States Army
This method has been popular amongst the armies around the world since guns and bullets are readily available
Firing squad was the lawful means of execution in Finland until 1944 when death penalty was abolished stopped by the law
In most cases not all the people firing have real bullets
After the execution it is not possible to determine which of the people firing killed the person just executed
Garroting a method of strangulation used in Spain for hundreds of years 
Crushing also called pressing used in the common law legal systems
A defendant who refused to plead stood mute would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon his or her chest until a plea was entered or the person suffocated 
Hanging Using a rope to either break the convicts neck or to choke strangulate him
Widely used around the world until the 20th century
Still today in use in some countries such as Iraq Singapore and Japan 
Drawing and Quartering  A very violent form of execution common in Medieval and Renaissance Europe
It involved taking a persons organs out while he was still alive then tying him to four horses going in different directions until his body is torn apart
A similar thing is breaking on the wheel when a wheel rather than horses is used to tear a persons body apart 
Cruxifixion This method means nailing the convict on a cross
It is considered as the most painful and nasty method of all
It was used by the Romans to punish traitors rebels and runaway slaves
Death by this method may take days
The convict dies from blood loss slow choking loss of water and fever caused by muscle cramps
Besides the Roman and Persian Empires this method was also used in feudal Japan
To fry food is to cook it in hot butter or vegetable oil
We can fry food in a small amount of butter or oil in a pan or in a lot of oil in a pot
Some restaurants also have large deep fryers to fry a lot of food at once
Fecund universes is a multiverse theory of Lee Smolin
It relies on models of our universe and statistics from astrophysics but is more correctly a theory of cosmology
In this theory collapsing stars or black holes are always creating new universes with slightly different laws of physics
Because these laws are only slightly different each is assumed to be like a mutation of the original universe as if each universe was a kind of singlecelled organism
It would reproduce by splitting in some sense
This theory relies on many models of our universe to model these mutated alternative universes the ones that Smolin supposes are generated or spun off by black holes
No human can ever be part of any of these other universes
Observations from astrophysics can only say if the black holes exist or are common and give some idea of how much the laws of physics can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes
Smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see since they are likely in a very late born universe by simple probability
If there are many black holes that is evidence for his theory   As this shows cosmology has a very different standard of evidence and burden of proof than is required for models of our universe only which humans using mathematics can observe and exchange knowledge on
It is hard to separate science from religion on such questions
It may be a simple matter of preference whether one wants to see ones universe as part of a system like biology or like mechanics  clockwork
Smolins theory is important mostly because it challenges the mechanistic paradigm
Even if it is wrong it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all
Some compare Smolins theory to Gaia philosophy which combines biology geology and ecology to explain the Earth our planet as a living thing
If both are right humans are on a living planet in a living universe
This idea is very appealing  which does not mean it is really right
plants that are eaten meat   Food is what people and animals eat to survive
Food usually comes from animals or plants
It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition
Food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy
The consumption of food is enjoyable to humans
It contains protein fat carbohydrates vitamins and minerals
Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called drinks
If someone cannot afford food they go hungry
Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening
It includes animal and vegetable sources
Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin like meat eggs and products with milk in them
Not eating meat is called vegetarianism
Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism
Foot is also the name of a unit of measurement
See foot unit of length
A foot one foot two or more feet is a body part on the end of a leg
It is used when walking
It is also important for balance it helps people stand straight
People also use it to kick in both fighting and sports football being an example
Peoples hands and feet have the same shape they both have five digits the fingers and toes
Many other animals with backbones also have five digits
The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the heel
The bottom of the foot is called the sole
Half the bones in our body are in the foot
Doctors who work with peoples feet are podiatrists or chiropodists
Many animals have feet and there are many different sorts of foot
The feet of monkeys are much like the hands
The hard foot of an ungulate is a hoof
When an animal has soft feet or feet with soft parts on the underside we often call it a paw
Many people like to use footwear especially outside
It has special names for example sandals shoes and boots
When people always wear footwear especially in hot places or when they are very active their feet can smell badly foot odour
Wearing footwear that is too big or small can be bad for the feet
People who have foot leg and back problems can also get help from special shoes
People have different traditions in different parts of the world for when to wear footwear
For example in much of Europe and Canada people usually do not wear their shoes or boots in a home or visiting
In the United States people often wear shoes inside a home
In Japan people do not wear shoes in homes and floors are often made of very soft materials too soft for shoes
In cultures where people always wear shoes people sometimes think it is bad not to wear them
Not wearing shoes can be good for the feet especially for childrens feet
Conditions like Athletes foot affect the feet causing the feet to feel dry and cracked
In a human foot there are 26 bones
They are made up of 14 phalanges toes 5 metatarsals sole bones and 7 tarsals ankle bones
Melaka Malaysia A farm is a piece of land used to grow crops  andor raise animals
People who grow these plants or raise these animals are called farmers
This type of work is called farming
Land that is used to grow plants is called farmland
Land that is used to feed animals with its grass is called pasture
Land that can be used to grow plants for food is called arable land
Many farms are very large and can cause damage
In some places farms are many and small
There are many types of farming
Some people farm to eat the food they produce subsistence agriculture
Other farms including large ones sell their products to many people far away in urban areas industrial farming
Most subsistence farms are in poorer countries while industrial farms are in richer countries

A farm that produces fruits or nuts is called an orchard 
A farm that produces grapes is called a vineyard 
A farm that raises and trains horses is called a stable 
A farm that produces milk and dairy products is called a dairy farm 
If the animals are raised for meat it is a ranch 
A large farm that produces nonessential crops like tobacco coffee cotton or sugarcane is called a plantation

Literary Arabic is the sole official language
Egyptian Arabic is the national spoken language
Other dialects and minority languages are used regionally
Egypt is a country in northeast Africa
Its capital city is Cairo
Egypt is famous for its ancient monuments such as the Pyramids and the Sphinx
Ancient Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country in the world
As a province of the Roman Empire it became Christian and some Coptic Church people are there after more than a thousand years of Muslim rule
The Fatimid Caliphate ruled Egypt in the tenth through twelfth centuries
Mamlukes ruled it until 1798 when Napoleon defeated them
Muhammad Ali Pasha soon took over and started a dynasty of Khedives under the Ottoman Empire
The Empire fell apart after World War I
Egypt became an independent country in 1922 and the khedive became a king
Egypt is a member of the United Nations and the Arab League
It became a republic after the Armys revolution of 1952
Egypt is a large country but a large portion of it is desert
Most people 95 of Egypts total people live in areas around the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and along the Nile River
This includes the cities of Cairo Alexandria Aswan and Port Said
Not many people live in the desert
Today Egypt has about 90 million people
Egypt is divided into 29 areas called Governorates of Egypt
Egypt is a country which has had many different rulers and many political systems
After World War II Egypt was still ruled by a king Farouk of Egypt 11 February 1920  18 March 1965
He was the last ruler of the Muhammad Ali dynasty
Farouk was overthrown on 23 July 1952 by a military coup
The coup was led by Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser
From then on Egypt had military rulers or rulers who had the backing of the army and many citizens
Nasser became President from 1956 to 1970
Later rulers were Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak
In January 2011 thousands of protesters gathered in Cairo
They wanted Hosni Mubarak to leave office
He had been the President for almost 30 years
On February 11 2011 Vice President Omar Suleiman made an announcement
He said that Mubarak agreed to leave office
In 2012 Egypt had a democratic election for the post of President
The winner was the Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi
The events which followed are still controversial but one aspect stands out
Morsi issued a declaration that in effect gave him unlimited powers
He had the power to legislate make laws without legal overview by the courts
This caused widespread protests
On 3 July 2013 he was unseated by a military coup council a coup dtat
After an election in June 2014 Abdel Fattah elSisi became President of Egypt
Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood rejected the change of regime as a military coup and not democratic
Today the people of Egypt are mostly Sunni Muslims
There are many Christians in Egypt today
Many of these belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria
The official language in Egypt is Arabic
The majority speak Egyptian Arabic but many speak other dialects
Some Egyptians still speak Coptic language
English
They also speak French and German in Egypt
These are taught in Egypt as additional languages
Many famous people are from Egypt
Some of these include Omar Sharif who was an international actor Boutros BoutrosGhali who was the first person from Africa to lead the United Nations and four Nobel Prize winners Anwar Sadat who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 Naguib Mahfouz who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988 Ahmed Zewail who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1999 and Mohamed ElBaradei who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005
Mohamed Salah is a famous footballer who plays for Liverpool in England
A famous Egyptian singer is called Amr Diab
Egypt is divided into 27 governorates
The governorates are divided into regions
The regions have towns and villages
Each governorate has a capital
Sometimes capital has the same name as the governorate
The word good can be an adjective that means something that is wanted
Something that is good is not

Good economics something that is useful
Good philosophy something that is important or valuable
                epoch  J20000  Earth is the planet we live on
It is the third planet from the sun
It is the only planet known to have life on it
Lots of scientists think the earth formed around 45 billion years ago
It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System
The other three are Mercury Venus and Mars
The large mass of the sun makes Earth move around it just as the mass of Earth makes the moon move around it
Earth also turns around in space so that different parts face the sun at different times
Earth goes around the sun once one year for every 365 times it turns around one day
Earth is the only planet in our solar system that has a large amount of liquid water
About 74 of the surface of Earth is covered by liquid or frozen water
Because of this people sometimes call it  blue planet
Because of its water Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals
The things that live on Earth have changed its surface greatly
For example early cyanobacteria changed the air and gave it oxygen
The living part of Earths surface is called the biosphere
axial tilt in relation to its path around the Sun Earth is part of the eight planets and many thousands of small bodies that move around the Sun as its solar system
The Solar System is moving through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy now and will be for about the next 10000 years
Earth is about  away from the sun this distance is called an Astronomical Unit
Earth moves on its orbit at an average speed of about  a second
Earth turns all the way around about 365 times in the time it takes for Earth to go all the way around the sun
To make up this extra bit of a day every year an additional day is used every four years
This is named a leap year
The Moon goes around Earth at an average distance of 
It is locked to Earth so that it always has the same half facing Earth the other half is called the dark side of the moon
It takes about 27 days for the Moon to go all the way around Earth but because Earth is moving around the Sun at the same time it takes about 29 days for the Moon to go from dark to bright to dark again
This is where the word month came from even though most months now have 30 or 31 days
Earth and the other planets formed about 46 billion years ago
They were made of the leftover gas from the nebula that made the Sun
The Moon may have been formed after a collision between the early Earth and a smaller planet sometimes called Theia
Scientists believe that parts of both planets broke off  becoming by gravity the Moon
Earths water came from different places
Condensing water vapour and comets and asteroids hitting Earth made the oceans
Within a billion years that is at about 36 billion years ago the first life evolved in the Archaean era
Some bacteria developed photosynthesis which lets plants make food from the Suns light and water
This released a lot of oxygen which was first taken up by iron in solution
Eventually free oxygen got into the atmosphere or air making Earths surface  for aerobic life see Great Oxygenation Event
This oxygen also formed the ozone  which protects Earths surface from bad ultraviolet radiation from the Sun
Complex life on the surface of the land did not exist before the ozone layer
Earth was very different in the distant past
Long ago almost all land was in one place
This is called a supercontinent
The earliest known supercontinent was called Vaalbara
Much later there was a time the Cryogenian when Earth was almost entirely covered by thick ice sheets glaciers
This is called the Snowball Earth theory
The Earths crust  is largely oxygen 47
Oxygen is normally a gas but it can join with other chemicals to make compounds like water and rocks
9922 of rocks have oxygen in them
The most common oxygenhaving rocks are silica made with silicon alumina made with aluminium rust made with iron lime made with calcium magnesia made with magnesium potash made with potassium and sodium oxide and there are others as well
Earths shape is a spheroid not quite a sphere because it is slightly squashed on the top and bottom
The shape is called an oblate spheroid
As Earth spins around itself the centrifugal force forces the equator out a little and pulls the poles in a little
The equator around the middle of Earths surface is about  long
The highest mountain above sea levelmdashthe wellknown Mount Everest which is  above sea levelmdashis not actually the one that is the farthest away from the center of the Earth
Instead the sleeping volcano Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador is it is only  above sea level but it is almost at the equator
Because of this Mount Chimborazo is  from the center of the Earth while Mount Everest is  closer to it
Similarly the lowest point below sea level that we are conscious of is the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean
It is about  below sea level but again there are probably places at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean that are nearer to the center of the Earth
The deepest hole ever dug is only about 
We know something about the inside of the Earth though because we can learn things from earthquakes and the times when volcanoes erupt
We are able to see how quickly the shock waves move through Earth in different places
The inside of Earth is very different from the outside
Almost all of Earths liquid water is in the seas or close to the surface
The surface also has a lot of oxygen which comes from plants
Small and simple kinds of life can live far under the surface but animals and plants only live on the surface or in the seas
The rocks on the surface of Earth Earths crust are well known
They are thicker where there is land between  thick
Under the seas they are sometimes only  thick
There are three groups of rocks that make up most of the Earths crust
Some rock is made when the hot liquid rock comes from inside the earth igneous rocks another type of rock is made when sediment is laid down usually under the sea sedimentary rocks and a third kind of rock is made when the other two are changed by very high temperature or pressure metamorphic rocks
A very few rocks also fall out of the sky meteorites
Below the crust is warm and almostliquid rock that is always moving around the Earths mantle
Then there is a thin liquid layer of heated rock the outer core
This is very hot 
The middle of the inside of the Earth would be liquid as well but all the weight of the rock above it pushes it back into being solid
This solid middle part the inner core is almost all iron
This is what makes the Earth magnetic
picture showing the Earths largest and most important plates   The Earths crust is solid but made of parts which move very slowly
The thin level of hard rock on the outside of the Earth rests on hot liquid material below it in the deeper mantle
This liquid material moves because it gets heat from the hot center of the earth
The slow movement of the plates is what causes earthquakes volcanoes and large groups of mountains on the Earth
There are three ways plates can come together
Two plates can move towards each other convergent plate edges
This can form islands such as Japan volcanoes and high mountain ranges such as the Andes and Himalayas
Two plates can move away from each other divergent plate edges
This gives the warm liquid rock inside the earth a place to come out
This makes special mountain ranges below the sea or large low lands like Africas Great Rift Valley
Plates are able to move beside each other as well transform plate edges such as the San Andreas Fault
This makes their edges crush against each other and makes many shocks as they move
The outside of the Earth is not even
There are high places called mountains and high flat places called plateaus
There are low places called valleys and canyons
For the most part moving air and water from the sky and seas damages rocks in high places and breaks them into small pieces
The air and water then move these pieces to lower places
Because of this the Earth would have been very flat a long time before now
The fundamental cause of the differences in the Earths surface is plate tectonics
The shape of the entire planet itself is not even a ball
Because of its velocity Earth has a slight bulge at the Equator
Other than that Earth is shaped more like a pear than an actual sphere
All places on Earth are made of or are on top of rocks
The outside of the Earth is usually not uncovered rock
Over 70 of the Earth is covered by seas full of salty water
This salty water makes up about 97 of all Earths water
The fresh water people can drink is mostly ice
Only a very small amount is in rivers and under the Earth for people to drink and use
The air above the Earth stops the water from going away into outer space
Also much of the land on Earth is covered with plants or with what is left from earlier living things
Places with very little rain are dry wastes called deserts
Deserts usually have few living things but life is able to grow very quickly when these wastes have rainfall
Places with large amounts of rain may be large woods
Lately people have changed the environment of the Earth a great deal
All around the Earth is a large amount of air the atmosphere
The mass of the Earth pulls the gasses in the air down and does not let them go into outer space
The air is mostly made of nitrogen about 78 and oxygen about 21 but there are a few other gasses as well
Most living things need the air or parts of the air gripped in the water to breathe and live
They use the gassesmdashespecially oxygen and carbon dioxidemdashto make and use sugar and to give themselves power
The air animals and plants use to live is only the first level of the air around the Earth the troposphere
The day to day changes in this level of air are named weather the changes between places far away from each other and from year to year are named the climate
Rain and storms are both in this level
Both come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up
Cold air becomes thicker and falls and warm air becomes thinner and goes up
The turning Earth moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the Earth generally gets more power from the Sun and is warmer than the north and south points
At the same time air over water specially very warm water gets water in it but because cold air is not able to take in as much water it starts to make clouds and rain as it gets colder
The way water moves around in a circle like this is called the water cycle
In the past the Earth has been much warmer and much colder than it is now
Since people have grown used to the heat we have now though we do not want the Earth to be too much warmer or colder
Most of the ways people create electric power use burning kinds of carbonmdashespecially coal oil and natural gas
Burning these creates new carbon dioxide and can cause more warming
A large discussion is going on now about what people should do about the Earths latest warming which has gone on for about 150 years
So far this warming has been good for people plants have grown better and the weather has been better than when it was colder before
Some people who learn about science though say that many bad things will possibly come about if the warming goes on
About seven billion people live on Earth
They live in about 200 different lands called countries
Some like Russia are large with many large cities
Others like the Vatican are small
The five countries with the most people are China India the United States Indonesia and Brazil
About 90 of people live in the north half of the world which has most of the land
Scientists think that people originally came from Africa
Now 70 of all people do not live in Africa but in Europe and Asia
People change the Earth in many ways
They have been able to grow plants for food and clothes for about ten thousand years
When there was enough food they were able to build towns and cities
Near these places men and women were able to change rivers bring water to farms and stop floods rising water from coming over their land
People found useful animals and bred them so they were easier to keep

Structure of the Earth         
ovary In botany a fruit is a plant structure that contains the plants seeds
To a botanist the word fruit is used only if it comes from the part of the flower which was an ovary
It is an extra layer round the seeds which may or may not be fleshy
However even in the field of botany there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified
Many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower
In general speech and especially in cooking fruits are a sweet product and many botanical fruits are known as vegetables
This is how ordinary people use the words
On this page we describe what botanists call a fruit
The fleshy part of a fruit is called the mesocarp
It is between the fruits skin exocarp and the seeds
The white part of an apple for example is the fleshy part of the apple
Usually when we eat a fruit we eat the fleshy part
If the entire fruit is fleshy except for maybe a thin skin we call the fruit a berry
A berry might contain one seed or many
Grapes avocados and blueberries are berries
They all have a thin skin but most of the fruit is fleshy
Strawberries however are actually not berries because the seeds are on the outside on a real berry the seed or seeds must be inside
A pepo pronounced pee po is a  berry
Its skin is hard and thick and is usually called a rind
Pumpkins and watermelons for instance are pepos
A hesperidium is another modified berry
It has a leathery skin that is not as hard as the skin of a pepo
All citrus fruit like oranges and lemon are hesperidiums
A pome pohm is a fruit that has a  surrounded by fleshy tissue that we can eat
The core is usually not eaten
Berries are different  the seeds are inside the fleshy part not separated from it by a core
Apples and pears are pomes
Drupes are also called stone fruit
A drupe is a fleshy fruit with a hard stone around the seed
We usually call this stone the pit of the fruit
Peaches and olives are drupes
Actually the almond fruit is a drupe too though we eat the seed that is inside the pit of the almond fruit
Since fruits are produced from fertilised ovaries in flowers only flowering plants produce fruits
Fruits are an evolutionary invention which help seeds get  by animals
The botanical term includes many that are not fruits in the common sense of the term such as the vegetables squash pumpkins cucumbers tomato peas beans corn eggplant and sweet pepper and some spices such as allspice and chillies
Strawberry fruit the seeds are each derived from a pistil of the flower An accessory fruit or false fruit pseudocarp is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue
A fig is a type of accessory fruit called a syconium
Pomes such as apples and pears are also accessory fruits the core is the true fruit
Strictly speaking these are not botanical fruits  
any produced by nonflowering plants like juniper berries which are the seedcontaining female cones of conifers 
fleshy fruitlike growths that develop from other plant tissues like rhubarb
cranberries lingonberries blueberries red huckleberries These are fruits which you can buy in shops and which are also acceptable as botanical fruits 
berry fruits redcurrant gooseberry cranberry blueberry Also but not commonly known as berry fruits are tomato avocado banana 
false berries blackberry strawberry raspberry they are aggregate fruits see below
The yew berry is not a fruit at all because the yew is a conifer 
stone fruits or drupes plum cherry peach apricot olive 
citrus fruits like oranges grapefruits and tangerines 
aggregate fruits raspberries blackberries 
multiple fruits pineapples figs  Many fruits come from trees or bushes
For plants fruits are a means of dispersal usually by animals
When the fruit breaks apart the seeds can go into the ground and begin to grow
Most fruits we eat contain a lot of water and natural sugars and many are high in Vitamin C
They have a large amount of dietary fibre
Fruits are usually low in protein and fat content but avocados and some nuts are exceptions to this
Not only humans but our closest living relatives primates are keen fruiteaters
So are many other groups of herbivorous mammals and many birds
Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce
Commercial bananas pineapple and watermelons are examples of seedless fruits
Some citrus fruits especially oranges satsumas mandarin oranges and grapefruit are valued for their seedlessness
Seedless bananas and grapes are triploids and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant which is produced by fertilisation
The method requires normal pollination and fertilisation

Goodness can mean that something is  or it can mean the amount that something is good
What goodness is has been talked about by philosophers who try to explain what goodness is
In food goodness is the part that is beneficial
Geography is the study of the Earth and its features its inhabitants and its phenomena
The word geography comes from the Greek words g Earth and graphein to write draw
It means to write and draw about the Earth
The word was first used by a scientist called Eratosthenes 276194 BC
Its features are things like continents seas rivers and mountains
Its inhabitants are all the people and animals that live on it
Its phenomena are the things that happen like tides winds and earthquakes
A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer
A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it how they started and how they have changed
Geography is divided into two main parts called physical geography and human geography
Physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment
The human environmental studies would include things such as the population in a country how a countrys economy is doing and more
There is also environmental geography
Geographers need to know a lot about maps because maps are very important for understanding geography
Geographers use maps a lot and often make them
Making maps is called cartography and similarly people who make maps are cartographers
Physical geography sometimes also called physiography is the natural science that covers the natural environment and the Earths surface
A geographer studying physical geography may look at  
Biogeography 
Climatology 
Landscape ecology 
Geomorphology 
Glaciology 
Hydrology 
Meteorology 
Oceanography 
Palaeogeography 
Pedology    Human geography is the social science that covers the study of people and their communities cultures economies and their interaction with the environment

Blue shark Carp seahorse
They are camouflaged as floating seaweed Dunkleosteus a giant armoured arthrodire of the later Devonian
Up to 6 metres long it lived in the Inland seas of North America   Fish plural fish or fishes are vertebrates which live in water and respire get oxygen with gills
They lack limbs with digits fingers  toes
This is a definition which does not quite work some amphibia also live in water and have external gills but they are not fishes
Fish used to be a class of vertebrates
Now the term covers five classes of aquatic vertebrates Jawless fish Armoured fish Cartilaginous fish Rayfinned fish Lobefinned fish  There are more fish than tetrapods land vertebrates there are over 33000 described species of fish
Fish are usually covered with scales
They have two sets of paired fins and several unpaired fins
Most fish are coldblooded poikilotherm
A fish takes in the oxygen from the water using gills
There are many different kinds of fish
They live in fresh water in lakes and rivers and in salt water in the ocean
Some fish are less than one centimeter long
The largest fish is the whale shark which can be almost 15 meters long and weigh 15 tons
Most fish live in the water
A group of fish called the lungfish have developed lungs because they live in rivers and pools which dry up in certain parts of the year
They burrow into mud and aestivate until the water returns
Fish is a paraphyletic term in cladistics because it lacks a monophyletic group of descendants
It does not include the land vertebrates or tetrapods which descended from fish
Though often used interchangeably these words have different meanings
Fish is used either as singular noun or to describe a group of specimens from a single species
Fishes describes a group of different species
Fish the oldest vertebrate group includes a huge range of types from the Middle Ordovician about 490 million years ago to the present day
These are the main groups  
Agnatha the jawless fish
Cambrian to present day 
Pteraspids the headshields 
Anaspids gills opened as holes
Silurian to endDevonian 
Cephalaspids early jawless fish 
Lampreys living ectoparasites 
Osteostraci bonyarmoured jawless fish 
Gnathostomata the jawed fish
Includes all types commonly called fish except the lamprey 
Placoderms heavily armoured fish 
Chondrichthyes cartilaginous fish sharks rays and skates 
Acanthodii extinct spiny sharks 
Osteichthyes bony fish 
Actinopterygii the rayfinned fish 
Chondrostei sturgeons and some other early types 
Neopterygii first seen in the later Permian lighter and fastermoving than previous groups 
Holostei the gars and bowfins 
Teleostei the most successful group Triassic to present day 
Sarcopterygii the lobefinned fish 
Dipnoi the lungfish eight genera survive 
Coelacanths two species survive
They were probably a sistergroup to the tetrapods
Certain animals that have the word fish in their name are not really fish Crayfish are crustaceans and jellyfish are Cnidarians
Some animals look like fish but are not
Whales and dolphins are mammals for example
physiology
The red fibres are usually alongside a much greater number of white fibres
The white fibres get their energy by converting the carbohydrate glycogen to lactate lactic acid
This is anaerobic metabolism that is it does not need oxygen
They are used for fast short bursts
Once the lactic acid builds up in the muscles they stop working and it takes time for the lactate to be removed and the glycogen replaced
Using their white fibres fish can reach speeds of 10 lengths per second for short bursts
Fishes with fusiform shapes can chase prey and escape predators quickly
Many live in the open ocean and swim constantly like marlins swordfish and tuna
Ichthyosaurs porpoises dolphins killer whales all have similar shapes
This is an example of convergent evolution
The long ribbonlike shape of an eels body shows another shape
This enables them to hide in cracks springing out quickly to capture prey then returning quickly to their hiding spot
Flatfish live on the bottom of the ocean or lake
Most use camouflage they change colors to match the ocean floor
Fish with compressed shapes have flat vertical bodies with one eye on each side
They swim upright and can be very thin
They usually live in reefs where their flat bodies can slip in and out among the corals sponges and rocks keeping hidden from predators
Angelfish surgeonfish and butterflyfish are all compressed fish
Koi and goldfish have been kept in decorative ponds for centuries in China and Japa Some people eat fishes
Many kinds of fishes are eaten
The fishes that people eat most include carp cod herring perch sardines sturgeon tilapia trout tuna and many others
A person who buys and sells fishes for eating is called a fishmonger
The word to fish is also used for the activity of catching fishes
People catch fishes with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats or with big nets from big boats
People can also catch fishes with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait
This is often called angling
Anglers also different types of fishing lures
Because people are catching too many fishes for food or other uses there are less and less fishes in the sea
This is a problem known as Overfishing
Selective breeding of carp made them into the domesticated koi in Japan and goldfish in China
This breeding began over 2000 years ago
The Chinese brought their goldfish indoors during the Song Dynasty
They kept them in large ceramic vessels
That we now do in glass fish tanks

The glass has two layers a coloured layer outside a clear laye  Glass is a  material that can be made in many shapes
It is usually transparent but it can also be made in colours
Glass is mainly made of silica glass is made of silica only is called silica glass
Glass used to make windows and bottles is a specific type called sodalime glass composed of about 75 silicon dioxide SiO sodium oxide NaO from sodium carbonate NaCO calcium oxide also called lime CaO and several minor additives
By changing the proportions and adding different ingredients many kinds of glass can be made
Coloured glass is made by adding small amounts of metal oxides
For example a blue colour is given by tiny amounts of cobalt oxide
Crystal glass is made by adding lead and zinc oxides
It is not actually a crystal because all glass is a noncrystalline solid
Crystal glass is called cut glass if it has been cut by hand  Cut glass is glass that has been decorated entirely by hand by use of rotating wheels
Cuts are made in an otherwise completely smooth surface of the glass by workers holding and moving the piece against various sized metal or stone wheels
Because glass is used to make lenses the word glasses means eyeglasses
The myth that glass is actually a liquid comes from the fact that old windows in houses and churches 200300 years old are sometimes a little out of shape thicker at the bottom than the top
This is actually due to the process of glass making in the past which led to the glass pane being thicker at one edge than the other
It was sensible to install the windows with the thick edge at the bottom
Sometimes a window can be found with the thick edge at the top of the window
Glass can be recycled over and over
Glass bottles and jars can easily be recycled to make new glass bottles and jars or used in industry as aggregate building material or sand

The Great Lakes are five large lakes in eastcentral North America
They hold 21 of the worlds surface fresh water
The lakes are 
Lake Superior 
Lake Michigan 
Lake Huron 
Lake Erie 
Lake Ontario     Four of the Great Lakes are on the border between Canada and the United States of America
The other Lake Michigan is completely inside the United States
All together by volume they are the largest group of fresh water lakes in the world
No one of the Lakes is larger than Lake Baikal Russia or Lake Tanganyika East Africa
The cities of Chicago Illinois 98 million people on Lake Michigan Toronto Ontario 55 million on Lake Ontario Detroit Michigan 53 million on the Detroit river Montreal Quebec 39 million on the St Lawrence River Cleveland Ohio 29 million on Lake Eyrie and Ottawa 12 million Ontario on the Ottawa River are on the shores of the Great Lakes or their rivers
Though the five lakes have separate basins they form a single connected body of freshwater
The lakes connect the eastcentral interior of North America to the Atlantic Ocean
Water flows from Lake Superior and Lake Michigan into Lake Huron then through the Detroit River into Lake Erie then through Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario and then through the Saint Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean
Water also drains from the Chicago River on the south
Many rivers flow through a large watershed into the lakes
The lakes have about 35000 islands
The Great Lakes region includes the five lakes and many thousands of smaller lakes often called inland lakes
The GNU Free Documentation License GNU FDL or simply GFDL is a copyleft license for open content
It was made up by the Free Software Foundation FSF for the GNU project
It was initially created for use with software documentation but can be applied to other types of works as well such as Wikipedia
As a copyright license the GFDL is a type of contract between the creator of a copyrightable work such as a book an encyclopedia article a painting or a piece of music and anyone else who might want to use it
The GFDL is considered copyleft because the license is meant to make it easier to use and reuse the copyrighted work not to restrict its use
If a copyrightable work is released under the GFDL the creator of the work is saying that anyone else may reproduce distribute or modify the work as long as they follow a set of requirements specified in the GFDL
Among the requirements of the GFDL are that any new work created from the original work is also licensed under the GFDLthat is once something is licensed as GFDL it will always stay licensed as GFDL and anything which uses it also is licensed as GFDL Because the license reproduces and stays with the work this is sometimes called a viral license
  The GFDL also says that in order to distribute or modify a work licensed with the GFDL the reuser must give credit to any previous authors of the work and include a list of changes they made to the work
Finally any work licensed with the GFDL must contain somewhere the entire text of the license
This provision has been criticized because it is not always easy to include an entire long license with a copyrighted work
In a book for example it is easy to include one extra page with the license but if the work is something like a song or a photograph it is not easy
The GFDL has other requirements that are more complicated
For example if part of the work is labeled as an invariant section it cannot ever be removed or changed by someone using the work invariant means does not change
Works licensed under the GFDL may be included in with nonGFDLlicensed works only if it is clear which parts of the work are licensed as the GFDL
For example in a book of poetry it would be easy to label some poems as licensed under the GFDL and some not licensed under it
But it would not be easy to label if part of a song was licensed as GFDL and the rest was not so this would not be allowed
Any use of GFDL material which violates the terms of the GFDL is potentially copyright infringement
A number of online projects use the GFDL
An online project to license its content under the GFDL is Wikipedia
The GFDL has been criticized by many people who wish that it made it even easier for content to be reused
Among the criticisms are that it is very hard to combine GFDL material with other copyleft licenses that it is not always clear and easy to understand and that some of its requirements such as the invariant sections are not free at all
The GFDL was released in draft form for feedback in September 1999
After revisions version 11 was issued in March 2000 version 12 in November 2002 and version 13 in November 2008
The current state of the license is version 13
Material licensed under the current version of the license can be used for any purpose as long as the use meets certain conditions
All previous authors of the work must be credited 
All changes to the work must be logged 
All derivative works must be licensed under the same license 
The full text of the license unmodified invariant sections as defined by the author if any and any other added warranty disclaimers such as a general disclaimer alerting readers that the document may not be accurate for example and copyright notices from previous versions must be maintained

Grammar is the study of words how they are used in sentences and how they change in different situations
The Ancient Greeks used to call it grammatik tkhn the craft of letters
It can have any of these meanings  The study of a language how it works and everything about it
This is background research on language  The study of sentence structure
Rules and examples show how the language should be used
This is a correct usage grammar as in a textbook or manualguide  The system which people learn as they grow up
This is the nativespeakers grammar
When we speak we use the native persons grammar or as near as we can
When we write we try to write with correct grammar
So speaking and writing a language each have their own style
All languages have their own grammar
Most European languages are rather similar but some such as Chinese and Japanese are very different from all European languages
English makes few changes to its word endings suffixes
In the Italic or Romance languages such as French Italian and Spanish word endings carry a lot of meaning
In English we have just a few plurals and possessives Johns are the most common
In our verbs we have dropped most endings except one I love you love but she loves
That final s is a remnant of AngloSaxon which had more suffixes
Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense walked walking
Word order is the other big difference
Romance languages normally put adjectives after the nouns to which they refer
For example in English a person may say I like fast cars but in Spanish it is Me gustan los coches rpidos
The order of the words has changed if just the words without the grammar are translated into English it would mean to me they please the cars fast
This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order
In German verbs often come near the end of sentences as Die Katze hat die Nahrung gegessen whereas in English we usually put them between subject and object as the cat has eaten the food
Written grammar changes slowly but spoken grammar is more fluid
Sentences which English speakers find normal today might have seemed strange 100 years ago
And they might not because many of our favourite sayings come from the Authorized King James Version of the Bible and from Shakespeare
Different people speak with grammar that differs from that of other people
For example people who use the dialects called General American English and BBC English might say I didnt do anything while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English or AAVE might say I didnt do nothing
London working class version I aint done nuffink
These are called double negatives and are found almost entirely in spoken English and seldom written
These differences are called dialects
The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live
Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order they still have grammar rules
However when writing in American English grammar uses the rules of General American English
When people talk about using proper English they usually mean using the grammar of general British English as described in standard reference works
The models for spoken English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English
Grammar studies nouns pronouns verbs adjectives adverbs prepositions conjunctions sentences phrases clauses interjections
Nouns are thing words like table and chair
They are  things you see in everyday life
Proper nouns are names of specific places people or other things like days of the week
The name James is a proper noun as is Wednesday and London
Nouns can also be abstract things such as suffering or happiness
Verbs are words that describe  Ryan threw the ball
State I am worried
The basic verb form is called the infinitive
The infinitive for existence is to be
A famous example is the speech of Hamlet To be or not to be that is the question
Variations of the infinitive create verb tenses
         Adjectives describe nouns
For example the pretty in pretty bicycle says that the bicycle is pretty
In other words the pretty is describing the bicycle
This can also happen with a place
For example the tall in thats a tall building is describing the building
Grammar studies syntax which is how the parts of speech fit together according to rules and create sentences
Sentences fit together and create paragraphs
Gods eye view is a name for a point of view where the speaker or writer assumes they have knowledge only God would have
It appears several ways  
In religion when an institution claims to speak for a divine being
In writing when an author leaves the point of view of the main actor to start writing about things they could not know if the story were in real life
In science when a scientist ignores the way a subjectobject problem affects statistics or an observer effect affects experiment
In medicine when the doctor makes a claim that The Gaze he uses on a patient actually sees the problem rather than making a guess at a problem
In ethics when a statement is made about who or what is right without an honest attempt to make the  of deciding this consider all points of view
A special case of the last is in a wiki with a GodKing
Often this person can get others to believe what they say about what is right without making any special effort to be fair to other views
Many people think Ren Descartes took a Gods eye view when he said cogito ergo sum
George Berkeley argued that optics from Isaac Newton and Johannes Kepler also had this problem
A gallon is a unit of measurement used to measure volume
People have used many different gallons throughout history
There are three types of gallon still in use
Yrei Japanese ghost from the Hyakkai Zukan ca
173 A ghost is considered to be the spirit of a dead person
Scientists say that there are no real ghosts but many people believe that there are
There are huge amount of   about ghosts in books and movies
Sometimes the ghost is the spirit of a person who was killed by someone  or who was already died
The ghost may stay on Earth because he or she has unfinished problems or is still trying to say good bye to people who they missed
Sometimes ghosts are said to live in a particular  for example an abandoned house
Sometimes the ghosts in these stories exist because of some problem the person had during life or to say good bye to loved ones that was not solved before he or she died
The ghost stays on the Earth trying to fix the problem
If the problem is fixed the ghost can leave the Earth
Many people say they have seen or heard ghosts
People who try to talk to ghosts as their job are called mediums
There can be bad ghosts and there can also be good ones
There have never been any ghosts that have actually hurt or killed people although people tell stories about it
Many people believe they have seen ghosts
Others believe they have felt ghosts near them
Often the ghost is said to appear as a feeling of cold and a light or a misty cloud but sometimes people say they have seen ghosts that look more like people
Sometimes ghosts are said to come in human form
Some ghosts might cause fear in the person who sees them by being seen suddenly
Some ghosts are said to be friendly and help people who have problems
Ghosts are said to form right after they die or even centuries later
Many people make up stories or urban legends
Many try to prove the existence of these paranormal creatures with special technology such as heat sensors
They also make TV shows dedicated to proving the existence of ghosts
They often investigate cases where a person has seen one or visit a place of sighting
Stories of ghosts can be found all over the world
Chinese philosopher Confucius said Respect ghosts and gods but keep away from them
  The most feared spirit in Thailand is Phi Tai Hong the ghost of a person who has died suddenly of a violent death
The Koran discusses spirits known as jinn
In Europe there is the recurring fear of returning or revenant deceased who may harm the living
This includes the Scandinavian gjenganger the Romanian strigoi the Serbian vampir the Greek vrykolakasuuuuuu among others

Brahma is the creator god in Hinduism
Brahma Shiva and Vishnu are the most important Hindu gods
This image shows Brahma on a temple wall   According to certain religions and mythologies God is the creator of the Earth and of everything else
Hinduism says that there is one God who can come in many forms
Theists believe that God created everything that s and has ever existed
In most religions God is believed to be immortal cannot die and to have powers to control nature far beyond the powers of humans
The belief that there is at least one god is usually called theism
People who reject belief that any deities exist are called atheists
Agnostics think we cannot know for sure whether any deities exist but still might or might not believe at least one deity exists
People who believe in a god but not in religion are called deists
People who believe that the definition of God should be defined before taking a theological position are ignostic
In some religions there are many gods
This is called polytheism
Some polytheistic religions are Hinduism Shinto Taoism and variants of Buddhism that syncronised with traditional folk religions it came into contact with
In other religions there is only one which is called monotheism
Some monotheistic religions are Christianity Judaism Islam and Sikhism
In polytheism the word gods is usually written in lowercase letters
God is usually written with an uppercase letter when only one god is believed to exist
Some polytheists also use uppercase when talking about their most important god
Many people have asked themselves if God exists
Philosophers theologians and others have tried to prove that it exists and others have tried to disprove the theory
In philosophical terminology such arguments are about the epistemology of the ontology of God
The debate exists mainly in philosophy as science does not address whether or not supernatural things exist
There are many philosophical issues with the existence of God
Some definitions of God are not specific
Arguments for the existence of God typically include metaphysical empirical inductive and subjective types
Some theories are built around holes in evolutionary theory as well as order and complexity in the world
Arguments against the existence of God typically include empirical deductive and inductive arguments
Conclusions sometimes include God does not exist strong atheism God almost certainly does not exist de facto atheism no one knows whether God exists agnosticism God exists but this cannot be proven or disproven deism or theism and God exists and this can be proven theism
There are many variations on these positions and sometimes different names for some of them
For example the position God exists and this can be proven is sometimes called gnostic theism or strong theism
There are different names for God in different religions
Some examples are Yahweh Elohim in Judaism and Christianity Allah in Islam Baha in Bah Faith and Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism
Eastern Orthodox ie Greece Romania etc or Muslim Turkey majorities tend to poll highest By the year 2000 approximately 53 of the worlds population were part of one of the three main Abrahamic religions 33 Christian 20 Islam  less than 1 Judaism 6 with Buddhism 13 with Hinduism 6 with traditional Chinese religion 7 with various other religions and less than 15 as nonreligious
Most of these religious beliefs involve God or gods
Abrahamic religions are very popular monotheistic ones
Wellknown Abrahamic religions include Judaism Christianity and Islam
Monotheistic means the people in these religions believe there is only one God
The name of God is usually not allowed to be said in Judaism but some Jews today call him YHWH Yahweh or Jehovah
Muslims say the word Allah which is the Arabic word for God
   Believers in the Abrahamic religions except Islamic believers believe that God has created human beings in his image but this idea is not easily understood by humankind
One artistic idea is that of an wise elder man in use since the Renaissance
The Christian Holy Bible talks about God in different ways
Within Christian canon the Old Testament talks about God the Father whilst the   New Testament is about Jesus or God the Son
Many Christians believe that Jesus was Gods incarnation on Earth
Christians consider the  Holy Spirit to be God as well the third person of God
In the New Testament there are three beings who are said to be God in different forms the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit also known as the Holy Ghost
This is called the Holy Trinity
Although the word Trinity is not in the Bible the word used for God in chapter one of Genesis is actually plural and the phrase in the name of the Father Son and Holy Spirit is used in the New Testament eg
Matthew 28
19
Another word that Christians believe has exactly the same meaning as Trinity is the word Godhead which is in the Holy Bible
Christians believe that God incarnated in a human body through the normal birth process normally growing up into a man named Jesus or Yeshua coming to Earth specifically to give every person an opportunity of salvation from their own evil called sin
The effect of personal evil far transcends the repercussions humans cause to one another in the world but affects ones relationship with God the Father and that aspect of the self cannot be addressed through ones own selfimprovement efforts but requires God to intervene in order to set one right
When Jesus prayed and talked to God he called him Father and taught others to do the same
Jesus also taught that one must be born again in order to receive Gods Spirit otherwise one remains separated from God acting merely from their own mind thus being vulnerable to deception by human philosophies or the many spiritual philosophies which do not come from God but from Fallen angels which are within various false religions
After a person consciously accepts the free gift of eternal life which Jesuss sacrifice offers God comes to live in the individual as God lived in humankind before the Fall
In Hinduism there is only one God named Brahman but Brahman is said to have taken on many different incarnations
Some of these are Rama Krishna Buddha Shiva Kali Parvati and Durga
To many outsiders the worship of Gods different incarnations is considered to be the worship of many gods
However it is really only the worship of one God in different ways
Some Hindus also believe that the spirit of God lives in everyone
This idea is called Advaita Vedanta which is the Hindu term for Monism
Religions like Buddhism and Confucianism involve the worship of many gods or sometimes no gods at all
Philosophers can talk about God or god sometimes they talk about a specific god but other times they are just talking about the idea of god
One of the earliest Western philosophers to write about God in a monotheistic way was the Greek Aristotle who describes god as the Supreme Cause
Aristotle saw God as a being that makes everything happen but is not influenced by anything else
There are also some philosophical problems with God
One of them is called God paradox
It is a question about whether an omnipotent God can make a mountain that is so heavy he cannot lift it
Deity 
Thomas Aquinas 
Immanuel Kant        
A government is a group of people that have the power to rule in a territory according to the law
This territory may be a country a state or province within a country or a region
Governments make laws rules and regulations collect taxes and print money
Governments have systems of  that list the acts or activities that are against the law and describe the punishments for breaking the law
Governments have a police force to make sure people follow the laws
Governments have diplomats who communicate with the governments of other countries by having meetings
Diplomats try to solve problems or disagreements between two countries which can help countries to avoid war make commercial agreements and exchange cultural or social experiences and knowledge
Governments have a military force such as an army that protects the country from terrorists and other major threats that attack or which can be used to attack and invade other countries
The leader of a government and his or her advisors are called the administration
Plato listed five kinds of government in The Republic   The most common type of government in the Western world is called democracy
In democracies people in a country can vote during elections for representatives or political parties that they prefer
The people in democracies can elect representatives who will sit on legislatures such as the Parliament or Congress
Political parties are organizations of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed
Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems
Democracy is the government of the people by the people and for the people
However many countries have forms of democracy which limit freedom of choice by the voters
One of the most common ways is to limit which parties who can for parliament or limit the parties access to mass media such as television
Another way is to rig the voting system by removing votes from opposition voters and substituting votes for the party in power
Few countries are textbook democracies and the differences between them has been much studied
A monarchy is a government ruled by a king or a queen who inherits their position from their family which is often called the royal family
 There are two types of monarchies absolute monarchies and constitutional monarchies
In an absolute monarchy the ruler has no limits on their wishes or powers
In a constitutional monarchy a rulers powers are limited by a document called a constitution
In modern times monarchies still exist in Great Britain and the Commonwealth the Netherlands Spain Japan Saudi Arabia and Thailand along with several other countries
A monarch may have one of several titles King or Queen Emperor or Empress or Emir
An aristocracy is a government by the best people usually people who come from wealthy families families with a particular set of values or people who come from a particular place
A person who rules in an aristocracy is an aristocrat
Aristocracy is different from nobility in that nobility means that one bloodline would rule an aristocracy would mean that a few or many bloodlines would rule or that rulers be chosen in a different manner
Under a dictatorship the government is run by one person who has all the power over the people in a country
Originally the Roman Republic made dictators to lead during time of war
The Roman dictators and Greek tyrants were not always cruel or unkind but they did hold on to power all by themselves rather than sharing power with the people
The Roman dictators only held power for a short period of time
In modern times a dictators rule is not stopped by any laws constitutions or other social and political institutions and can last many years or even decades
After World War II many governments in Latin America Asia and Africa were ruled by dictators
Examples of dictators include Josef Stalin Adolf Hitler Augusto Pinochet  Idi Amin Muammar alQaddafi and Gamal Abdul Nasser
The rules of these dictators continued from when they took power until when they died because they would not allow any other person or law to take power from them
There is no evidence of a woman serving as a dictator in modern times
An oligarchy is a government ruled by a small group of powerful people
These people may spread power equally or not equally
An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things
An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or passed down from father to son
An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several powerful people
Some past examples of oligarchy are the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Apartheid South Africa
A fictional example is the dystopian society of Oceania in the book Nineteen EightyFour
Some critics of representative democracy think of the United States as an oligarchy
This view is shared by anarchists
The simplest idea of government is those who rule over  and land
This may be as small as a community or village or as big as a continent like Australia and India
The people who rule can allow others to own land
It is a  by government that gives this right in the way that laws describe
Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission
This view is called libertarianism
Others think they can do without government
This view is called anarchism
Almost every place on Earth is connected to one and only one government
Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules small border disputed areas and the continent of Antarctica because almost no people live there
For every other place on Earth there is a government that claims sovereign control over it
The word sovereign is old and means control by a King sovereign
Governments of villages cities counties and other communities are subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist and then to that of the country
It is from Kings and feudalism that modern governments and nation states came
The capital of a country for instance is where the King kept his assets
From this we get the modern idea of capital in economics
A government may  trade as well as to rule over land
Governments also control people and decide things about what morality to accept or punish
In  many countries there are strict rules about sexual intercourse and drugs which are part of law and offenders are punished for disobeying them
Tax is how government is paid for in most countries
People who buy sell import invest own a house or land or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government
There are many theories of how to organize government better
These are called theories of civics
Many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy
That way they can be replaced at election
Many governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power
There are many theories of how to run a government better and keep people from hurting each other
These theories are part of politics

Geometry is a kind of mathematics that studies the size shapes positions and dimensions of things
We can only see or draw shapes that are  2D or solid 3D but mathematicians people who study math are able to study shapes that are 4D 5D 6D and so on
Squares circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry
Cubes cylinders cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry
Plane geometry can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a flat shape
Solid geometry can also measure a solid shapes volume and surface area
Geometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things
For example geometry can help people find 
the surface area of a house so they can buy the right amount of paint 
the volume of a box to see if it is big enough to hold a liter of food 
the area of a farm so it can be divided into equal parts 
the distance around the edge of a pond to know how much fencing to buy
Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics
Geometry began as the art of measuring the shape of land so that it could be shared fairly between people
The word geometry means to measure the land
It has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics
The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote the first book about geometry a book called The Elements
Plane and solid geometry as described by Euclid in his textbook Elements is called Euclidean Geometry
This was simply called geometry for centuries
In the 19th century mathematicians created several new kinds of geometry that changed the rules of Euclidean geometry
These and earlier kinds were called nonEuclidean not created by Euclid
For example hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry come from changing Euclids parallel postulate
NonEuclidean geometry is more complicated than Euclidean geometry but has many uses
Spherical geometry for example is used in astronomy and cartography
Geometry starts with a few simple ideas that are thought to be true called axioms
Such as 
A point is shown on paper by touching it with a pencil or pen without making any sideways movement
We know where the point is but it has no size 
A straight line is the shortest distance between two points
For example Sophie pulls a piece of  from one point to another point
A straight line between the two points will follow the  of the tight string 
A plane is a flat surface that does not  in any direction
For example imagine a wall that extends in all directions infinitely

Pinwheel galaxy is a spiral galaxy   A galaxy is a huge group of many stars and space dust
The word galaxy is taken from the Greek word galaxias where this word goes to the Milky Way our galaxy
Gravity holds galaxies together against the general expansion of the universe
In effect the expansion of the universe takes place between groups of galaxies not inside those groups
This is because the mass of a galaxy holds the galaxy together and the same applies to the groups of galaxies such as our Local Group where Milky Way is located
The gravitation is produced by the matter and energy in a galaxy or group of galaxies
Everything in a galaxy moves around a centre of mass which is also an effect of gravity
There are various types of galaxies elliptical spiral and lenticular galaxies which can all be with or without bars
Then there are irregular galaxies
All galaxies exist inside the universe
There are probably over 170 billion 17x10 galaxies within the observable universe
There are galaxies of different sizes
Typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million 10 stars up to giants with a hundred trillion 10 stars all orbiting the galaxys center of mass
Galaxies may contain many multiple star systems star clusters and various interstellar clouds
The Sun is one of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy the Solar System includes the Earth and all the other objects that orbit the Sun
Star clusters are not galaxies they are inside galaxies
Globular clusters are sphericalshape star cluster which are part of the outer halo of the Milky Way
One of the largest and oldest known star clusters Messier 15 has several million stars packed closely together with a black hole at its centre
The stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies
Within galaxy clusters galaxies move relative to other galaxies
They can and do collide
When this happens the stars generally move past each other but gas clouds and dust interact and can form a burst of new stars
Gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes forming bars rings or taillike structures
constellation Antila produces new stars at a rate of 1 or 2 stars per yea  Many galaxies also continue to form new generations of stars
The Milky Way and all spiral shaped galaxies like it see right side image of NGC 2997 produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year
This star formation happens in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about 1 to 10 of the mass of these galaxies
Globular star clusters on the other hand are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up
In the astronomical literature the word Galaxy with a capital G is used for our galaxy the Milky Way
The billions of other galaxies are just written as galaxy with a lowercase g
The term Milky Way first came out in the English language in a poem by Chaucer
They are divided into two  
Barred spiral galaxy classified as SB 
Unbarred spiral galaxy classified as SA NGC 1300 and NGC 1672 are examples of barred spiral galaxy
Whirlpool galaxy and Messier 81 are examples of unbarred spiral galaxy
The identifying characteristics of a spiral galaxy are diskshaped rotating spiral arms and a bulge in the galactic core
The spiral arms are where new hot stars are born
Bulge in the galactic core has old stars
This feature is common to the most spiral galaxies
ESO 325G004 is an elliptical galaxy  An elliptical galaxy is a galaxy that has a ellipsoid 3D of ellipse shape
This type of galaxy are dominant in universe especially in galaxy cluster The size of an elliptical galaxy can be measured as an effective radius which defines the area from which half its light comes
The mass of elliptical galaxy is also large
A giant elliptical galaxy can have mass of 10 many trillions of solar masses
Lenticular galaxy NGC 5308   The simple definition of lenticular galaxy is a galaxy seen in a disc shape
Determining the shape of a lenticular galaxy is difficult because the shape can be between spiral galaxy and elliptical galaxy
The shape can be known by looking at the bulge of the galactic center
If the bulge is very bright it is a spiral galaxy

People first came to Finland 10000 years ago
That was just after an ice age after a glacier that covered the ground had receded
Some think the first people in Finland already spoke a language similar to the Finnish language that is spoken today
It is known that an early form of the Finnish language was spoken in Finland in the Iron Age The Iron Age in Finland was 2500800 years ago
The first residents in Finland hunted animals as huntergatherers
Some people started to farm crops about 5200 years ago
Farming slowly became more and more popular and became the major way of life until the modern age
axe from Finland  The ancient Finns were pagans
The most important god of the Finnish pantheon was Ukko
He was a god of sky and thunder much like Odin another Scandinavian godking
These powers were common among the pagan god kings in pantheons ranging from the Finnish Ukko to the ScandinavianGermanicSaxon Odin all the way east to Zeus of the Greeks and Jupiter of the Romans
Around a thousand years ago when most of Europe was adopting Christianity Finland also began following Christianity
During the Reformation of Christianity in the 16th century most Finns became Protestants
Some pagan practices still remain amongst the now Christian Finns such as bear worship
From the Middle Ages Finland was a part of Sweden
Then in the year 1809 Russia took Finland from Sweden
Finland was a part of Russia but after a short period of time it became autonomous
The Finns essentially controlled Finland though the Tsar was in control officially
Finns could create their own laws and had their own currency called the markka their own stamps and own customs
However Finland did not have its own army
During the 1905 Russian Revolution in the Grand Duchy of Finland  the Social Democrats organised the general strike of 1905 
The Red Guards were formed
On  Russian artillerymen and military engineers rose to rebellion in the fortress of Sveaborg later called Suomenlinna Helsinki
The Finnish Red Guards supported the Sveaborg Rebellion with a general strike but the mutiny was quelled by loyal troops and ships of the Baltic Fleet within 60 hours
demonstration in 1905  in Jakobstad   On 6 December 1917 Finland became independent which meant that it no longer was a part of Russia
There was a communist revolution in Russia and after 1922 Russia was a part of the Soviet Union
There were communists in Finland too who tried to create a revolution in Finland
This attempt at revolution caused the Finnish civil war
The communists lost the civil war and Finland did not change its old capitalist system
Stalin who was the leader of the Soviet Union did not like having a capitalist country as its neighbour
Stalin wanted Finland to become a communist state and be a part of the Soviet Union
The leaders of Finland refused they wanted to stay independent
The Soviet Union sent many troops across the eastern border of Finland to try to make Finland join them which resulted in the Winter War
The Soviet Union eventually won and took most of Karelia and other parts of Finland
Adolf Hitler was the dictator of Germany and he wanted to invade the Soviet Union
Finland wanted to retrieve the areas that it had lost so they joined the German invasion which started with Operation Barbarossa in 1941
The Finnish part of the Second World War is called the Continuation War in Finland
However Finland was not a fascist or an antisemitic country
Finns were interested in freedom rather than dictatorship
While Germany was losing the war Finland had already progressed into the Soviet Union in order to regain the areas lost in the previous peace
Finland wanted to end the war with the Soviet Union which resulted in peace
Once again Finland had to give up the areas they had conquered
This time the peace with the Soviet Union made Finland and Germany enemies
Finns fought the Germans and Germans retreated to Norway burning down all of Lapland behind them
This is called the Lapland War
Finland remained independent
After the war many factories were built in Finland
Many people moved from farms to cities
At that time big factories manufactured products like paper and steel
More and more people worked in more advanced jobs like high technology
Also many people went to universities to get a good education
Finland was one of the first countries where most people had Internet connections and mobile phones
A wellknown company that makes mobile phones Nokia is from Finland
Finland joined the European Union in 1995
The Finnish currency was changed to the euro in 2002

February Feb is the 2nd month of the year coming between January and March with 28 days in common years and 29 days in leap years
In Sweden in 1732 the month had 30 days
This was to make the calendar match the rest of the world
In 1930 and 1931 February had 30 days in the Soviet Union because the government changed all the months to be 30 days long
This   days in it
The name comes either from the Roman god Februus or else from februa the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month
February begins on the same day of the week as March and November in common years and August in leap years
February always ends on the same day of the week as October and additionally January in common years
Valentines Day February 14 February is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar at the beginning of the year the other is January
This is because in the original Roman calendar the two months of winter when not much would happen in agriculture did not have names
February is the second month of the year coming between January and March and is also the shortest month with 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year
February begins on the same day of the week as March and November in common years and on the same day of the week as August in leap years
February ends on the same day of the week as January in common years and October every year
In a leap year February is the only month to begin and end on the same day of the week
Every year February starts on the same day of the week as June of the previous year
In common years February finishes on the same day of the week as May of the previous year and in leap years August and November of the previous year
In common years immediately before other common years February starts on the same day of the week as August of the following year and in leap years and years immediately before that May of the following year
In years immediately before common years February finishes on the same day of the week as July of the following year and in years immediately before leap years April and December of the following year
February is also the only month of the calendar that once every six years and twice every 11 years consecutively either back into the past or forward into the future will have four full 7day weeks
In countries that start their week on a Monday it occurs as part of a common year starting on Friday in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday this was observed in 2010 and can be traced back 11 years to 1999 6 years back to 1993 11 years back to 1982 11 years back to 1971 and 6 years back to 1965 and will be observed in 2021
In countries that start their week on a Sunday it occurs in a common year starting on Thursday with the next occurrence in 2026 and previous occurrences in 2015 11 years earlier than 2026 2009 6 years earlier than 2015 1998 11 years earlier than 2009 and 1987 11 years earlier than 1998
This works unless the pattern is broken by a skipped leap year but no leap year has been skipped since 1900 and no others will be skipped until 2100
From circa 700BC when Numa Pompilius the second king of Rome added it to the calendar February had 23 days and 24 days on some of every second year until 46BC when Julius Caesar assigned it 29 days on every fourth year and 28 days otherwise
Leap year Day February 29 is added in every year that can be divided equally by four such as 2012 and 2016 but this does not apply when the year ending in 00 at the turn of the century does not divide equally into 400
This means that 1600 and 2000 were leap years in the Gregorian calendar but 1700 1800 and 1900 were rather common years
This is where the Julian calendar calculated dates differently as it always repeated February 29 every four years
February is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere and a summer month in the Southern Hemisphere
In each hemisphere it is the seasonal equivalent of August in the other
In weather lore Groundhog Day in the United States is set to decide what the weather will be like for the rest of the winter
Februarys flower is the violet and its birthstone is the amethyst
The meaning of the amethyst is sincerity
The zodiac signs for February are Aquarius January 21 to February 19 and Pisces February 20 to March 20

Greece  Harbour means to shelter or keep safe
A harbor or harbour is a place where ships may shelter
Some harbours are used as ports to load and unload ships
The port will have quays or piers where the ships may be moored or tied up and a transport system for taking goods inland
Often railway and road transport will be used
Goods also move by pipeline transport and by smaller ships on rivers
Harbors can be natural as in San Francisco or artificial as in ancient Carthage or a mix of both
During the DDay operations of 1944 two artificial harbors named mulberry were built just off the beaches where the invasion was going to happen

Graph theory is a field of mathematics about graphs
A graph is an abstract representation of a number of points that are connected by lines
Each point is usually called a vertex more than one are called vertices and the lines are called edges
Graphs are a tool for modelling relationships
They are used to find answers to a number of problems
Some of these questions are 
What is the best way for a mailman to get to all of the houses in the area in the least amount of time
The points could represent street corners and lines could represent the houses along the street see Chinese postman problem  
A salesman has to visit different customers but wants to keep the distance traveled as small as possible
The problem is to find a way so they can do it
This problem is known as Travelling Salesman Problem and often abbreviated TSP
It is among the hardest problems to solve
If a commonly believed conjecture is true described as P  NP then an exact solution requires one to try all possible routes to find which is shortest
How many colors would be needed to color a map if countries sharing a border are colored differently
The points could represent the different areas and the lines could represent that two areas are neighboring look at the Four color theorem  
Can a sketch be drawn in one closed line
The lines of the drawing are the lines of the graph and when two or more lines collide there is a point in the graph
The task is now to find a way through the graph using each line one time look at Seven Bridges of Knigsberg    
Graph theory has many aspects
Graphs can be directed or undirected
An example of a directed graph would be the system of roads in a city
Some streets in the city are one way streets
This means that on those parts there is only one direction to follow 
Graphs can be weighted
An example would be a road network with distances or with tolls for roads 
The nodes the circles in the schematic of a graph are called vertices
The lines connecting the nodes are called edges
There can be no line between two nodes there can be one line or there can be multiple lines
Leonhard Euler used to live in a town called Knigsberg Its name changed to Kaliningrad in 1946
The town is on the river Pregel
There is an island in the river
There are some bridges across the river
Euler wanted to walk around and use each of the bridges once
He asked if he could do this
In 1736 he published a scientific article where he showed that this was not possible
Today this problem is known as the Seven Bridges of Knigsberg
The article is seen as the first paper in the history of graph theory
This article as well as the one written by Vandermonde on the knight problem carried on with the analysis situs initiated by Leibniz
Eulers formula was about the number of edges vertices and faces of a convex polyhedron was studied and generalized by Cauchy and LHuillier and is at the origin of topology
Over a century after Euler Cayley studied a special class of graphs called the trees
A tree is a graph where there is only one path between two vertices
Cayley tried to solve a problem from differential calculus
His solution influenced the development of theoretical chemistry
The technique he used mainly focused on listing all graphs which had certain properties
Today this is called Enumerative graph theory
It developed from Cayleys results a scientific publication done by  Plya between 1935 and 1937 and the generalization of these by De Bruijn in 1959
Cayley linked his results on trees with the contemporary studies of chemical composition
The fusion of the ideas coming from mathematics with those coming from chemistry is at the origin of a part of the standard terminology of graph theory
In particular the term graph was introduced by Sylvester in an article published in 1878 in Nature
One of the most famous and productive problems of graph theory is the four color problem Is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors
 This problem was first posed by Francis Guthrie in 1852 and its first written record is in a letter of De Morgan addressed to Hamilton the same year
Many incorrect proofs have been proposed including those by Cayley Kempe and others
The study and the generalization of this problem by Tait Heawood Ramsey and Hadwiger led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary genus
Taits reformulation generated a new class of problems the factorization problems particularly studied by Petersen and Knig
The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by Turn in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory extremal graph theory
The four color problem remained unsolved for more than a century
A proof produced in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken which involved checking the properties of 1936 configurations by computer was not fully accepted at the time due to its complexity
A simpler proof considering only 633 configurations was given twenty years later by Robertson Seymour Sanders and Thomas
The autonomous development of topology from 1860 and 1930 fertilized graph theory back through the works of Jordan Kuratowski and Whitney
Another important factor of common development of graph theory and topology came from the use of the techniques of modern algebra
The first example of such a use comes from the work of the physicist Gustav Kirchhoff who published in 1845 his Kirchhoffs circuit laws for calculating the voltage and current in electric circuits
Graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science
To many such problems exact solutions do exist
Many times however they are very hard to calculate
Therefore very often approximations are used
There are two kinds of such approximations MonteCarlo algorithms and LasVegas algorithms
Graphs are normally represented by two different sets typically set a graph G would be represented as the collection of the sets V and E
The set V is a discrete set containing all vertices of the graph
The set E is a binary set whose pairwise elements are elements of set V
Each pair in set E represents an edge connecting two vertices
If every two nodes have an edge between them then the graph is called the complete graph
The Island of Hawaii is the largest US Hawaiian Island and it is the farthest south
It is also called the Big Island
 Its area is 4038 sq
miles 10 458 square kilometers
The widest part of the island is 93 miles 150 km across
The Big Island has more than half 62 of the total land area of State of Hawaii
It is part of County of Hawaii
The island is seven separate shield volcanos that erupted more or less one at a time one partly covering the other
These are from oldest to youngest Kohala extinct Mauna Kea dormant Hualalai dormant Mauna Loa active Kulani extinct mostly buried and Kilauea very active
The volcanos were caused by the Pacific oceanic tectonic plate moving over a hotspot
There lava from the Earths lower mantle or upper core is close to the surface
The largest city on the island is Hilo
Hilo has many historic buildings interesting shops parks many performances festivals and events
It is on the rainy east side of the island
The city of KailuaKona is on the dry west side of Hawaii and is popular with tourists

Health is a state of complete  mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease according to the World Health Organization WHO
Physical is about the body
Mental is about how people think and feel
Social talks about how people live with other people
It is about family work school and friends
Flu shot     Physical fitness refers to good body health
It is dependent on genetic determinators and also on social economic and ecological factors
That means ones genes are partly responsible for ones physical health but also other circumstances where you live how clean or polluted your water and the air around you is and also how good your social and medical system is
It is also the result of regular exercise proper diet and nutrition and proper rest for physical 
A person who is physically fit will be able to walk or run without getting breathless and they will be able to carry out the activities of everyday living and not need help
How much each person can do will depend on their age and whether they are a man or woman
A physically fit person usually has a normal weight for their height
The relation between their height and weight is called their Body Mass Index
A taller person can be heavier and still be fit
If a person is too heavy or too thin for their height it may affect their health
Mental health refers to a persons emotional and psychological wellbeing A state of emotional and psychological wellbeing in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional feeling abilities  in society and meet the  demands of everyday life
  One way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person functions
Feeling  and  being able to handle normal levels of stress have good friends and family and lead an  life and being able to bounce back or  from hardships are all signs of mental health
Public health refers to trying to stop a disease that is unhealthy to the community and does not help in long life or promote your health
This is fixed by organized efforts and choices of society public and private clubs communities and individuals
It is about the health of many people or everybody rather than one person
Public health stops instead of encouraging a disease through surveillance of cases
To prevent being sick it is good to act according to some simple advice  Hand washing regular checkups  vaccination programmes drinking clean water and using condoms
When infectious diseases break out washing hands for about 30 seconds may be especially important
Sometimes it is necessary to avoid masses of people or wear a surgical mask to protect yourself and to stop the spreading of the disease
Teaching people how to live healthily and educate them especially about sex and childbirth is also very important

History is the study of past and future events
People know what happened in the past by looking at  from the past including sources like books newspapers and letters and artifacts like pottery tools and human or animal remains Libraries archives and museums collect and keep these things for people to study history
A person who studies history is called a historian
A person who studies prehistory and history through things left behind by ancient cultures is called an archaeologist
A person who studies mankind and society is called an anthropologist
The study of the sources and methods used to study and write history is called historiography
People can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened in the past
This is called oral history
When people who had been slaves and American Civil War survivors got old some historians recorded everything that they said so that history would not be lost
In old times people in different parts of the world kept separate histories because they did not meet each other very often
Some groups of people never met each other
Medieval Europe Ancient Rome and Ancient China each thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were barbarian

Healing is a process that happens in the body
Through healing cells are able to repair damaged tissue
There are two different ways healing can happen 
The damaged tissue is replaced with tissue of the same kind
This is called regeneration 
The damaged tissue is replaced with scar tissue
This is called repair  Most healing processes combine both ways of healing

It is also the largest city in Hawaii and it has the most important harbor
It is on the southeast shore of the island of Oahu
Honolulu means sheltered harbor in the Hawaiian language
No one knows for sure when Honolulu was first settled or when the name was first used
Honolulu harbor was called Kulolia before foreigners came
The first foreigner was Captain William Brown of the English ship Butterworth in 1794
He named the harbor Fair Haven
Other foreign captains is started calling it Browns Harbor
The name Honolulu was used some time after that
Honolulu quickly became the most important harbor of Hawaii
At that time sandalwood was a big export
Honolulu was also an important supply point for whalers
Kamehameha III made Honolulu the capital city of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1850
It was also the capital of the Republic of Hawaii and the Territory of Hawaii
It stayed the capital when Hawaii became a state in 1959

Spain is a country in Europe
People have lived on the Iberian Peninsula for about 500000 years
Neanderthal man came about 200000 years ago
Modern humans first came about 40000 years
Thousands of years ago Iberians and Celts lived there and the Phoenicians made a few cities there to get tin and silver to trade
The Roman Empire controlled Spain for three hundred years then people from Eastern Europe called Visigoths fought for Spain won it from the Romans and controlled Spain for over two hundred years
Lady of Elche made by the Iberian   The Visigoths converted from Arian Christianity to Roman Catholics
The land was won after a war by Muslims who were Arab and Berber
Roman Catholics from Europe eventually decided to fight to take Spain from the Muslims
They fought wars for many hundreds of years some of which were Crusades against other Christians like the Cathars
These were very cruel wars
In the year 1492 they took the last part of Spain that had belonged to the Moors
Boabdil the last Moorish Leader of Granada gave the city to King Ferdinand of Aragon on 2 January 1492 and Christians now ruled all of Spain
Before this several different kings had ruled different countries in what is now called Spain
Two of these countries Castile and Aragon came together when the king of Aragon Ferdinand II married the queen of Castile Isabella
In the same year 1492 they decided to send Christopher Columbus to explore the Atlantic Ocean
Columbus found a land there that the people of Europe did not yet know
These were the islands of the Caribbean Sea
Columbus and other sailors explored more and found that there were two continents there  North America and South America
Spain sent many soldiers and businessmen to North and South America and they took over very large parts of those two continents
Owning this empire made Spain very rich
But when they conquered that empire they killed millions of the Native Americans who had lived there before
Spain owned this empire for more than three hundred years
Meanwhile at home the Muslim manuscripts had been either burnt or spread to other countries
Jews had been expelled from Spain
The multicultural society was destroyed and so was the learning
Among the few things kept and respected in Spain were in music harmony and stringed instruments and of course the buildings many of which became churches by adding crosses
The Spanish Empire was the strongest in the world through most of the next two centuries thanks to gold from the Americas
This new gold made rulers and colonial governors rich
Meanwhile others savings became worth less due to inflation
Spain became a society of very rich and very poor
Some of the poorest went to the new colonies in the Caribbean Central America and South America mostly to find gold
Native American peoples were killed by diseases brought by the Spaniards but most Spaniards did not know this
They found damaged and dying societies with people who had lost some of their most important leaders and thinkers
The Spaniards thought this meant they were inferior and used this as an excuse to enslave the natives
Millions of natives died mining gold for the Spanish
The Spanish Empire also at this time funded the Spanish Inquisition which tortured and killed anyone who disagreed with the Roman Catholic Church
The Reformation which created Protestant sects in Europe was not allowed into Spain it was kept out and as with Jews or Muslims its believers were killed
The nobles of Spain no longer had to fight anyone since the internal feuds were over
No one could challenge their power
In many ways it was held together as a reign of terror
People who challenged them were often called heretics so that the Inquisition could torture them and then nobles take the property
For ordinary people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean life got worse
A few rulers got rich
Today we would say that these people were guilty of war crimes genocide and crimes against humanity
Many Church people who had the power to speak out at that time did so and they said many of the same things as we would say today
But none of this mattered much to the rulers
The great satire Don Quixote was written about this time
In the 18th century there was doubt over who should become king of Spain this doubt led many of the kings of Europe to fight to become king of Spain
This was called the War of the Spanish Succession
France occupied Spain for a long time
This made Spain very weak
It also made Spain lose its empire in North and South America all of the parts of that empire became their own countries or were taken over by other countries such as the United States of America
There was not much peace in Spain during the first part of the 20th century
Some Spaniards tried to set up a government chosen by the people a democracy and they made the King of Spain leave the country
However in 1936 two different groups of Spaniards went to war over whether the government should be a democracy or take orders from one person
In 1939 those who wanted democracy were defeated and a dictator named Francisco Franco took over the government
Franco died in 1975
He had decided that Spain should have a king again and he chose Juan Carlos the grandson of the king who had been forced to leave the country to be king
But the king did not rule as a dictator instead he chose to set up a democracy
Also since Francos death Spain appointed Adolfo Surez to became Spains first democratically elected prime minister
Now Spain is a modern democratic country and does business with many countries around the world
It is a part of the European Union

The human body is the body of a person
It is the physical structure of a person
The body is a thing that can be hurt or killed
Its functions are stopped by death
You need your muscles and your joints to move
Some people study the human body
They look at where it is different from or the same as other animals bodies
These animals can be alive today
Or they can be extinct animals like other hominids Hominids are primates that are close to humans
Neanderthals and Homo erectus were hominids
 Some people study how the human body works and lives in its environment
Some people study what people think about their body
Artists study how to draw or paint the human body
Many different fields of study look at the human 
Biology is a field of science
It studies living things
It looks at how the human body works
It studies how the human body came from evolution
It studies how genetics makes the human body 
Anatomy studies the parts of the body and how they work together 
Ecology studies the environment including how humans affect it 
Physical anthropology is a field of science
It compares humans to other hominids
It also studies all other hominid bodies
They look at how humans and chimpanzees are the same or different 
Psychology is a field of medicine
It looks at how people think and feel
The brain is part of the body
How we think and feel comes from the brain
So psychologists study the body
They study how the brain lets us be who we are 
Religion also talks about the body
Some religions see the body as where the soul lives
Some see the body as like a church
This is because a church is where people worship God
These people think God should be worshiped inside people
Some religions think the body is made from chakras that connect us to the universe 
Medicine sees the body like a machine
Doctors want to fix problems with the body
They study how to fix the problems called diseases
The human body is like other animals
The skeleton muscles and other parts are very much like those of other primates
Our body is also like other mammals and somewhat like other vertebrates
DNA differences follow a similar pattern
The human genome is closer to that of other primates than to other vertebrates and closest to chimpanzee
People have lived in Australia for over 75000 years
The first people who arrived in what is now Australia were the Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders
The aboriginal people came by boat from the islands of Indonesia
They lived in all parts of Australia
Their lives were simple they had very few needs
They lived by hunting fishing and gathering
Aborigines invented tools like the boomerang and spear but did not farm to be confirmed
Tradition was very important in their lives
Their religion is called the Dreamtime which has lots of stories about the creation of the world by spirits
Aboriginal art started at least 30000 years ago and there are lots of Dreaming stories painted on walls and cut in rocks all around Australia
Aboriginal music has songs about the Dreamtime sometimes with special instruments like the didgeridoo
In 1606 the first European Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon 15711639 visited the west
Luis Vaez de Torres sailed through the water between Australia and Papua New Guinea later that year
Only after Dirk Hartog chanced upon the west coast in 1616 did other European vessels visit and map the coast
After sixty more ships visited the coast enough was known for a map to be published in 1811
The land was dry because of not much rain some was a desert
The explorers thought no crops could be grown and so it would be difficult for people to live there
They decided there would be no economic reasons to stay
In 1642 Dutchman Abel Tasman working for the Dutch East Indies Company reached Tasmania which he called Antony van Diemenslandt
He then called the continent he charted the north coast of on his second visit in 1644 New Holland
In 1688 William Dampier became the first Englishman to reach Australia
But in 1770 a British sailor Captain James Cook found the fertile east coast of Australia
He called it New South Wales and claimed it for Britain
In 1850 elections for legislative councils were also held in the colonies of Victoria South Australia and Tasmania
In 1855 limited selfgovernment was granted by London to New South Wales Victoria South Australia and Tasmania
A new secret ballot was introduced in Victoria Tasmania and South Australia in 1856 allowing people to vote in private
This system was copied around the world
In 1855 the right to vote was given to all men over 21 in South Australia
The other colonies soon followed
Australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent
But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament

Google makes money by advertising
People or companies who want people to buy their product service or ideas give Google money and Google shows an advertisement to people Google thinks will click on the advertisement
Google only gets money when people click on the link so it tries to know as much about people as possible to only show the advertisement to the right people
It does this with Google Analytics which sends data back to Google whenever someone visits a web site
From this and other data Google makes a profile about the person which it then uses to figure out which advertisements to show

Milton Sirotta nephew of US mathematician Edward Kasner made this word in 1938 for the number 1 followed by one hundred zeroes

French cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by Georges Auguste Escoffier 18461935
He was a genius at organisation
He worked out how to run large restaurants as in a big hotel or a palace how the staff should be organised how the menu was prepared
He had methods for everything
Escoffiers largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903 which established the fundamentals of French cookery
Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Hotel in London the Htel Ritz Paris and some of the greatest cruise ships
Escoffier however left out much of the culinary character to be found in the regions of France

The Internet is the biggest worldwide communication network of computers
Internet  has millions of smaller domestic academic businessand government networks which together carry many different kinds of information
The term is sometimes abbreviated as the net
The World Wide Web is one of its biggest services
It is used by a few billion people all over the world
The Internet was developed in the United States by the United States Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA
Internet was first connected in October 1969 and was called ARPANET
The World Wide Web was created at CERN in Switzerland in 1990 by a British UK scientist named Tim BernersLee
Today people can pay money to access the Internet from internet service providers
Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use
Sometimes people who offer these free services use advertising to make money
Censorship and freedom of speech on the Internet can be controversial
The Internet is used for many things such as electronic mail online chat file transfer and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web
The most used service on the Internet is the World Wide Web which is also called the Web
The Web contains websites including blogs and wikis like Wikipedia
Webpages on the Internet can be seen and read by anyone unless the page needs a password or it is blocked
The second biggest use of the Internet is to send and receive email
Email is private and goes from one  to another
Instant messaging such as AIM or ICQ is similar to email but allows two or more people to chat to each other faster
Some governments think the Internet is a bad thing and block all or part of it
For example the Chinese government thinks that Wikipedia is bad
Many times no one in China can read it or add to it
Some parents block parts of the Internet they think are bad for children to see

People often send secret information and sometimes other people can steal that information
They can use the Internet to spread lies or stolen secrets or dangerously bad advice
For example Facebook has had some problems with privacy settings
A person can post information on the website but this is often a bad idea unless the person is very sure of what they are doing
One way to check for a secure website is to make sure the URL starts with  instead of 
This means it is secured so other people cannot read information while it is being sent
However it does not mean the website will do things to keep it safe
Some websites may trick people into downloading viruses that can harm a computer or spyware that spies on its users looks at what they are doing and tells someone else
Emails can also have harmful files with them as attachments 
In internet chatrooms people might be preying on others or trying to stalk or abuse them 
The Internet contains content that many people find offensive such as pornography as well as content intended to be offensive 
Criminals may steal peoples personal information or trick people into sending them money

predicted      isolation date1895  airships such as the Goodyear blimp Helium is a chemical element
It has the chemical symbol He atomic number 2 and atomic weight of about 4002602
There are 9 isotopes of helium only two of which are stable
These are He and He
He is by far the most common isotope
Helium is called a noble gas because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new compounds
It has the lowest boiling point of all the elements
It is the second most common element in the universe after hydrogen and has no color or smell
However Helium has a blueish neon color when being burnt with fire
Helium does not usually react with anything else
Astronomers discovered helium in 1868
They found that it was in the Sun before it was found on Earth
Because of where it was found its name comes from the Greek word for Sun helios
Helium is used to fill balloons and airships because it is lighter than air and does not burn or react meaning it is normally safe for using it in that way
It is also used in some kinds of light bulbs
People also breathe it in to make their voices sound higher than they normally do as a joke but this is extremely dangerous as if they breathe in too much it can kill them as they are not breathing normal air
Breathing too much helium can also cause longterm effects to vocal cords
It can be created through the process of nuclear fusion in the sun
During this process four Hydrogen atoms are fused together to form one helium atom
Helium has become a rare gas
If it gets free into the air it leaves the planet
Unlike hydrogen which reacts with oxygen to form water helium is not reactive
It stays as a gas
For many years the USA kept a storage tank filled with helium which came naturally from the great plains area
The story of this supply is very complicated
At present more helium is supplied by Qatar than by the USA
Several research organisations have released statements on the scarcity and conservation of helium

Hair is something that grows from the skin of mammals
Animal hair is usually called fur
Sheep and goats have curly hair which is usually called wool
Hair is made of keratin 
It can protect against losing body heat
This is thought to be the basic original function of hair 
It protects against UV radiation which damages the skin 
It can protect against rain or water
Air can be trapped in the fur or oil can be secreted by the skin
Both these methods prevent the rain or water from  making the body too cold
Aquatic mammals in cold waters usually have blubber fat under the skin and almost no hair 
Defence hair is modified in mammals like porcupines for protection 
Hair colouring can perform different functions
It helps to camouflage in some animals and to signal to others of the same species in some other animals
Examples are signalling to females for mating purposes and signalling to others for territory control
Signalling danger to other species aposematic colouring is also done by for example skunks 
Animals can change their hair so they look bigger or more threatening
This can also be used for mating which is the case with lions for example
Also the male lions mane also protects their neck from damage when fighting other males
Some animals for example certain insects and spiders also have hairs
However these are not hair in the biological sense but are actually bristles
The hairs found on certain plants are also not true hair but trichomes
In humans hair grows mostly on the head and the amount of body hair is different from race to race
Asians and native North Americans have the least amount of body hair while Caucasians tend to have the most
black brown blonde white red Hair color is passed down by parents only
Natural hair color can be given only by genes
It is impossible to have a hair color that is not passed down genetically by both mother and father
This relies on dominant and recessive genes carried by a parent
These genes may not be the color of their hair however many people carry genes that are recessive and do not show in their traits or features
Dyeing hair is to change the color of hair
It consists of a chemical mixture which can change the color of hair by a chemical reaction
Many people dye their hair to hide gray or white hairs
This is because most people gain white or gray hairs as they grow older

Red ink would need iron oxide such as haematite from ground rocks instead of soot
Later in Europe people used iron gall ink
This is the kind of ink Johann Sebastian Bach and Leonardo da Vinci used
Now ink colours are produced by dyes
Ink in a ball point pen is held in a thin long cylinder tube inside the pen
The ink does not fall out of the cylinder as it sticks to the sides of the tube

It is the most likely basis for accounting reform which could put an end to accounting scandals
An idiom is a common word or phrase which means something different from its literal meaning but can be understood because of their popular use
Because idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly
Some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times
The idiom shape up or ship out which is like saying improve your behavior or leave if you dont might be said by an employer or supervisor to an employee but not to other people
Idioms are not the same thing as slang
Idioms are made of normal words that have a special meaning known to almost everyone
Slang is usually special words or special meanings of normal words that are known only to a particular group of people
To learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language and how and when to use them
But people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings
In order to understand an idiom one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from
To know the history of an idiom can be useful and interesting but is not necessary to be able to use the idiom properly
For example most native British English speakers know that No room to swing a cat means there was not much space and can use the idiom properly
However few know this is because 200 years ago sailors were punished by being whipped with a cat o nine tails
A big space was cleared on the ship so that the person doing the whipping had room to swing the cat
An idiom is a phrase whose meaning cannot be understood from the dictionary definitions of each word taken separately
Break a leg  A way to wish someone good luck 
To live it up  To enjoy life to live widely 
To kick the bucket  To die 
Shape up or ship out  Used to tell someone that they should leave if they dont improve their behavior or performance 
To shed crocodile tears  To cry about something but without actually caring 
Wild goose chase  A useless journey or pursuit 
Theres no room to swing a cat  There is not a lot of space 
To pay through the nose  To pay a lot of money more than is normal 
To bark up the wrong tree  To choose the wrong course of action 
To spill the beans  To tell a secret 
Its raining cats and dogs  Its raining heavily 
To get into hot water  To get into trouble

The pint abbreviated pt is a unit of volume in Imperial and US units
There are several types of pints used in different countries
An Imperial pint and US pint both equal  of a quart and  of a gallon
An Imperial fluid ounce is approx
4 smaller than a US fluid ounce although an Imperial pint has 4 more fluid ounces than a US pint making 1 Imperial Pint roughly 20 larger than a US pint in total
The Imperial pint is the pint used in the United Kingdom Canada Ireland and Burma
The unit may appear in other Commonwealth countries that converted to the Metric System
Confusion in Canada often arises as liquids are often sold in US pints although the official and only pint that is legal in Canada is the Imperial pint
The Imperial system has no dry pint and volume in dry units eg
apples are the same as liquid pints
1 Imperial pint of water at 62 F 167 C weighs 1 lbs 56699 g     
The Wet and Dry US pints are still commonly used in the United States 
In Canada it is commonly used for alcohol although a pint can vary from 12 fl oz to 20 fl oz and is sometimes incorrectly given in US fl oz 
In the United Kingdom and Ireland milk alcohol and cooking ingredientstools are often given in pints although due to EU regulations most liquids are now given in metric units with occasional dual units 
In the United Kingdom milk is often sold in metric quantities equivalent to Imperial pints
The inch is a unit of length in the Imperial system and the United States customary system
The abbreviation for inches is in or 
There are 12inches in a foot
One inch is equal to 254centimetres
The word inch came from Middle English unche which came from Old English ynce from Latin uncia meaning a twelfth part
The inch was originally defined as 3 barleycorns
The inch was finally standardised in the International Yard and Pound Treaty in 1959 between the United States the United Kingdom South Africa Australia New Zealand and Canada
The international yard was made equal to 09144 metres
From this subdivisions and multiples of the yard were specifically defined
In the United States people use inches more than they use millimetres or centimetres
In the rest of the world international units are almost always used
The inch is not used by scientists
In the United Kingdom road signs that show how high a vehicle can be in order to pass through a tunnel are required to be in feet and inches
Theme parks and drive thru signs usually show it in metres
People regularly measure their height in feet and inches
Official medical records however are required to record peoples height in metric measurements only
In Canada a mix of centimetres and inches are used in height
Older generations especially use Imperial units
A lot of exposure to Americanized phrases leads to younger generations often having a good understanding of both the Imperial and metric systems
In the United States height is always in feet and inches
Science is the only field to use metric measurements
Other Commonwealth countries including Ireland Australia New Zealand and Jamaica use inches to varying degrees
From every day use to exclusively the older community

An insult is a description of someone that will  them
It may or may not be true
It is called derogatory language
Terms like    and  are insults because they say that a persons mind is not quick or smart
Insulting someones mother directly is a serious insult in many cultures
Ritual insults are part of many cultures
For example they can be found in sports and military training
They are also very common in jargons
For example the word newbie is a part of net jargon
Calling someone a newbie is usually insulting
One should be very careful when using new words to describe others
Usually someone insults others because they want to feel like they are better or have more power influence than the people they insult
They may want this because they are actually afraid that they are worse or less powerful than the people they are insulting
When someone is insulted his or her pride is hurt
He or she may want to fight back by insulting the person who insulted him or her
Europe Ireland is a large island located in western Europe
It is about 486 kilometers 302 miles long and about 288 kilometers 179 miles wide
To the west of Ireland is the Atlantic Ocean to the east of Ireland across the Irish Sea is the island of Great Britain
Great Britain and Ireland together make up the British Isles
Over 64 million people lived on the island in 2016 
Northern Ireland which is one of the four countries of the United Kingdom makes up the remaining 17 of Ireland and is in the northeast part of the island
It has a population of 18 million people and its capital and largest city is Belfast
From 1801 to 1927 all of Ireland was part of the same country called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
In 1919 a war broke out the Irish War of Independence and in 1922 the Irish Free State became independent
After a new constitution came into effect in 1937 the state became a republic
Northern Ireland stayed with the UK and this would lead to The Troubles beginning in the 1960s and ending with the Good Friday Agreement signed in 1998
The flag colours of the Republic of Ireland are green white and orange 
A symbol of Ireland is the shamrock 
Popular games in Ireland include Gaelic football and hurling 
The population is around 47 million 
The president of the Republic of Ireland is Michael D
Higgins 
The two parts of Ireland are the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland 
The River Shannon which runs from north to south is the longest river on the island
Ireland has many lakes
Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland is the largest lake in Ireland
Ireland is known for its landscapes music history and mythology
Ireland is traditionally divided into four provinces and thirtytwo counties
Twentysix counties are in the Republic and six in Northern Ireland
Three of the provinces are entirely within the Republic Connacht Leinster and Munster and one province Ulster has some counties in both the Republic and in Northern Ireland

It is the capital of the Republic of Ireland
Dublin was established as a Viking settlement in the 9th century
The population is 525383 in Dublin City and 1270603 in Co
Dublin
Belfast is the capital of Northern Ireland
It has 483000 people in the Greater Belfast urban area there are 267000 in the city itself
Shipbuilding used to be a major industry here
The Titanic was built in Belfast at the Harland and Wolff shipyard
Armagh is a city in Northern Ireland
It is often called the Ecclesiastic Capital of Ireland as it is the seat of both the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church of Ireland
The population is 14590
Cork is the largest city in Munster
Corkonians often jokingly refer to it as the Real Capital
The population is 119230
Derry is the second largest city in Northern Ireland
Derry is notable for the Medieval city walls which still stand
Because the walls have never been breached the city is nicknamed The Maiden City
In 2013 Derry was the UK Capital of Culture
Many cultural events took place there during the year
The population is 83652
During the last glacial period the ice age most of Ireland was covered with ice
After that Ireland became covered with trees
The first people came to Ireland about 9000 years ago in the Middle Stone Age Mesolithic period
They were nomadic
Once food ran out in the place they lived they would move to another place
Evidence of these people was found in Mount Sandel Co
Derry
About 4000 BC in the New Stone Age Neolithic period the first farmers arrived in Ireland
These people cleared openings in the forest and built permanent settlements with houses and farmland
When people in this age died they were buried in tombs called megaliths
Many megaliths are left standing today such as portal dolmens and passage tombs
The most famous megalith is Newgrange passage tomb in co
Meath
New settlers came around 2000BC marking the start of the Bronze Age
Copper was mined mainly in Mount Gabriel co
Cork and tin was imported from Cornwall
These people used bronze to make weapons such as swords
They also used it to make early forms of jewellery such as sun discs and torcs
These settlers buried the dead in court tombs or wedge tombs and burial places have been found with stone circles
It is unknown when the Celts came to Ireland but it is likely they brought the use of iron with them
The use of iron marks the start of the Iron Age
It is known that by about 300BC the use of iron and Celtic culture was widespread in Ireland
The Celts lived in ring forts hill forts promontory forts and cranngs
It is thought that only the richer families and settlements lived in cranngs
These were manmade islands in the middle of lakes with houses on them
Celtic Ireland was split into around 150 kingdoms called tuath
The king was elected from the royal family
Below the king were the Nobles and the Aos Dna who were people with special skills such as poets Druids priests judges and craftsmen
By the early 6th century Ireland was mostly Christian through the work of St Patrick and other missionaries
Druids were replaced by priests and monks
Monasteries soon were built such as Glendalough in co
Wicklow
Glendalough and other monasteries built round towers for safety when Vikings attacked
Small monasteries were also built in remote places the most famous being Skellig Michael off the coast of co
Kerry
At this time many handwritten manuscripts were created by the monasteries
They include the Cathach the Book of Durrow and the Book of Kells
Monks also produced fine silver chalices croziers and brooches and carved high crosses
In 1169 AngloNorman lords invaded Ireland
They were led by Strongbow
He landed at Passage Co
Waterford
The AngloNormans conquered many parts of Ireland the following 60 years
They introduced their way of life
The feudal system was soon introduced in Ireland as means of organising land
Castles were built to defend the land like Trim Castle co
Meath
During the Middle Ages Irelands first proper towns were built
From 1801 until 1922 all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
In 1921 Northern Ireland was created and partitioned from the south
Northern Ireland has stayed within the United Kingdom since then
The full name of the UK is The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
In 1922 the south became the Irish Free State
In 1937 the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution which named the state Ireland and in 1948 this state passed the Republic of Ireland Act which declared it to be a republic
Many Irish people have left Ireland and moved to the United States Canada Australia and South America
The Great Famine in the 1840s forced many to leave it is estimated almost a million people died of starvation and a million more emigrated
From a maximum of over 8 million in 1841 the total Irish population dropped to just over 4 million in the 1940s
Since then the population has grown to over 6 million
This has been helped by the economic growth of the Celtic Tiger and since 2004 immigration from countries in Eastern Europe such as Poland
Today almost 80 million people around the world are descended from Irish immigrants
Irelands main sports are Gaelic Games Gaelic football hurling etc and soccer
The many sports played and followed in Ireland include Gaelic games mainly Gaelic football hurling and camogie horse racing show jumping greyhound racing basketball fishing handball motor sport MMA boxing target shooting and tennis
Hockey golf rowing cricket rugby union and Olympic target shooting are organised in an allisland basis with a single team representing the whole of Ireland in international competitions
Other sports such as soccer and netball have separate organizing bodies in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
As Northern Ireland is a constitute nation of the United Kingdom it also sends a Northern Ireland Team to the Commonwealth Games
At the Olympic Games a person from Northern Ireland can choose to represent either Ireland or Great Britain
Soccer is the most popular team sport in terms of participation
According to the Irish Sports Monitor 2015 annual report 48 of adults over 15 participate in Soccer
Gaelic football 2 camogie 12 rugby 11
Individual exercise pursuits are most popular with 43 of all sport participated by individuals on their own
Personal exercise 137 running 82 swimming 8 cycling 55 dancing 3 golf 27 weights 23 yoga 15 and pilates 14
Soccer is by far the most popular team pursuit for males at 88 with gaelic football attracing 34
Personal exercise 134 and running 89 are the most popular male activities
Team sports do not figure highly amongst females with dancing at 46 and yoga 24 are two of the highest shared activities
Given the variety of sports in Ireland it is of interest to note how the governments Capital Sports programme 2017 allocated its 56 million funds 235 million went to the GAA which highlights the strength of the GAA lobby 725 million to soccer Rugby 31 million tennis 264 million golf 197 million sailing 121 million athletics just under 1 million diving 451000 while other sports did not fare so well
Gaelic Football is one of the most popular sports in Ireland in terms of match attendance and in 2003 had 34 of total sports attendances at events in the Republic of Ireland followed by hurling at 23 soccer at 16 and rugby at 8
Initiatives ViewerTrack study which measured 2005 sports audiences showed the sports highestprofile match the AllIreland Football Final to be the most watched event of the nations sporting year
Soccer is the most played team sport in Ireland

Its atomic number is 1 which makes it the simplest known element in the entire universe
Hydrogen is the very oldest substance the first kind of atom produced after the Big Bang
All chemical elements were formed from hydrogen by the processes of nuclear fusion
Hydrogen glows purple when it is in plasma state
In its pure form on Earth hydrogen is usually a gas
Hydrogen is also one of the parts that make up a water molecule
Hydrogen is important because it is the fuel that powers the Sun and other stars
Hydrogen makes up about 74 of the entire universe
Hydrogens symbol on the Periodic Table of Elements is H
Pure hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen atoms connected together
Scientists call these diatomic molecules
Hydrogen will have a chemical reaction when mixed with most other elements
It has no color or smell
Pure hydrogen is very uncommon in the Earths atmosphere
In nature it is usually in water
Hydrogen is also in all living things as a part of the organic compounds that living things are made of
In addition hydrogen atoms can combine with carbon atoms to form hydrocarbons
Petroleum and other fossil fuels are made of these hydrocarbons and commonly used to create energy for human use
Hydrogen has two different isotopes called deuterium and tritium
Like regular hydrogen they both have only one proton and one electron but deuterium also has one neutron and tritium has two
These other types of hydrogen are important in nuclear energy and organic chemistry reactions
Some other facts about hydrogen 
It is a gas at room temperature 
It acts like a metal when it is solid 
It is the lightest element in the Universe 
It is the most common element in the Universe
The electrolysis of water easily breaks water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity
Burning hydrogen combines with oxygen molecules to make steam pure water vapor
A fuel cell combines hydrogen with an oxygen molecule releasing an electron as electricity
For these reasons many people believe hydrogen power will eventually replace other synthetic fuels
Hydrogen can also be used as fuel in a fuel cell or burned to make heat for steam turbines or internal combustion engines
Hydrogen can be created from many sources such as coal natural gas or electricity and therefore represents a valuable addition to the power grid in the same role as natural gas
Such a grid and infrastructure with  is now planned by a number of countries including Japan Korea and many European countries
This allows these countries to buy less petroleum which is an economic advantage
The other advantage is that used in a fuel cell or burned in a combustion engine or turbine there is no pollution
Only water and a small amount of  nitrogen oxides forms

June is one of two months to have a solstice the other is December its seasonal equivalent in both hemispheres and in this month the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere is turned towards the Sun meaning that June 20 or June 21 is the Northern Summer Solstice and the Southern Winter Solstice
This means that this date would have the most daylight of any day in the Northern Hemisphere and the least in the Southern Hemisphere
There are 24 hours of daylight at the North Pole and 24 hours of darkness at the South Pole
The solstice occurs around June 21 but it may occur on either the 20th or the 22nd
It is the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere and the winter solstice in the southern hemisphere 
Midsummer is celebrated in Sweden on the third Friday in June

Jargon is a special way to use words that are shared only by a certain group of people
They do not mean what the dictionary says they mean
They have different meanings to the people using them than their everyday meaning
For example the ordinary words boot net and web also have special meanings for users of computers the Internet and the World Wide Web
These and to flame to ping and many acronyms are part of net jargon
An acronym means that only some of the letters in the word or phrase are used
Often this is the first letter of each word
Other acronyms found online are simply common shorthand
See list of slang words
Usually more jargon is created over time
Jargon is also common in the military
It includes phrases like SNAFU
Jargon can be used by a clique to prevent others from joining or understanding but it also is often just used because it is shorter

Immunology is the study of the immune system
The immune system is the parts of the body which work against infection and parasitism by other living things
Immunology deals with the working of the immune system in health and diseases and with malfunctions of the immune system
An immune system is present in all plants and animals
We know this because biologists have found genes coding for tolllike receptors in many different metazoans
These tolllike receptors can recognise bacteria as foreign and are the startingpoint for immune reactions
The type of immunity which is triggered by the tolllike receptors is called innate immunity
This is because it is entirely inherited in our genome and is fully working as soon as our tissues and organs are properly developed
Vertebrates and only vertebrates have a second type of immunity
This is called adaptive immunity because it remembers previous infections
Then if the same infection occurs again the reaction is much stronger and faster
This immunological memory confers a tremendous survival advantage and with it vertebrates can survive over a long lifetime in a pathogenfilled environment
In the 18th century PierreLouis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom
This and other observations of acquired immunity led to Louis Pasteur 18221895 developing vaccination and the germ theory of disease
Pasteurs theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease such as the miasma theory
It was not until the proofs Robert Koch 18431910 published in 1891 for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905 that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease
Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 when the yellow fever virus was discovered by Walter Reed 18511902
Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century through rapid developments in the study of humoral immunity and cellular immunity
Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich 18541915 who proposed the sidechain theory to explain the specificity of the antigenantibody reaction
The Nobel Prize for 1908 was jointly awarded to Ehrlich and the founder of cellular immunology Ilya Mechnikov 18451916
The simplest form of immunity is the DNA restriction system in bacteria that prevents infection by bacteriophages

infinity symbol Infinity is about things which never end
Sometimes it is also written 
Infinity means many different things depending on when it is used
The word is from a Latin word which means without end
Infinity goes on forever so sometimes space numbers and other things are said to be infinite because they never come to a stop
Infinity is not really an ordinary number but it is sometimes used as one
Infinity often says how many there is of something instead of how big something is
For example there are infinitely many whole numbers called integers but there is no integer which is infinitely big
But different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity
So its meaning often changes
There are two kinds of infinity potential infinity and  infinity
Potential infinity is a process that never stops
For example adding 10 to a number
No matter how many times 10 is added 10 more can still be added
Actual infinity is a more abstract idea
For example there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down
Mathematicians have different sizes of infinity and three different kinds of infinity
The number of things beginning with 0 1 2 3  to include infinite cardinal numbers
There are many different cardinal numbers
Infinity can be defined in one of two ways Infinity is a number so big that a part of it can be of the same size Infinity is larger than all of the natural numbers
There is a smallest infinite number countable infinity
It is the counting number for all of the whole numbers
It is also the counting number of the rational numbers
The mathematical notation is the Hebrew letter aleph with a subscrpt zero 
It is spoken aleph null
It was a surprise to learn that there are larger infinite numbers
is 
The number of mathematical functions is the next infinite cardinal number 
And these numbers go on without end
A different type of infinity are the ordinal numbers beginning first second third 
The order first second third  and so on to infinity is different from the order ending  third second first
The difference is important for mathematical induction
The simple first second third 
has the mathematical name the Greek letter omega with subscript zero  Or simply omega 
 The infinite series ending  third second first is 
The third type of infinity has the symbol 
This is treated as addition to the real numbers or the complex numbers
It is the result of division by zero or to indicate that a series is increasing or decreasing without bound
The series 1 2 3  increases without upper bound
This is written the limit is 
In calculus the integral over all real numbers is written    Each kind of infinity has different rules
Addition with alephs is commutative
Multiplication with alephs is commutative

Addition with omegas is not commutative
Multiplication with omegas is not commutative
Otherwise division by infinity is not meaningful
Subtraction with infinity is not meaningful

crown and scepter are symbols of the power of a kin A king is a man who rules a country because of inheritance
A king usually comes to power when the previous monarch dies who is usually a family member of his
Sometimes a person may become king due to the previous monarchs abdication for example George VI
For most of history most countries were ruled in this way especially in Europe
Some countries such as France are no longer monarchies
Some such as the United Kingdom still have a royal family
In some countries people chose a new king from other people to decide from
The wife of a king is called a queen
A woman who becomes a ruler because of inheritance is also called a queen
If a country has a king or a queen that means it is a monarchy
A country which a king or queen rules is called a kingdom

Kauai Kauai in Hawaiian is the oldest and fourth largest of the main Hawaiian Islands in the United States
Known also as the Garden Isle Kauai lies 105 miles 170 kilometers across the Kauai Channel northwest of Honolulu on Oahu
It is of volcanic origin
The highest point is Mount Waialeale at the center of the island 5148 feet 1570 meters above sea level
The wettest spot on Earth with average rainfall of 460 inches 11648 millimeters a year is just east of Mount Waialeale
The high yearly rainfall has eroded deep valleys in the central mountain
It has made canyons with many scenic waterfalls
The city of Lihue on the islands southeast side is the seat of Kauai County
It is the main city on the island
Waimea on the islands southwest side and once the capital of Kauai was the first place visited by explorer Captain James Cook in 1778
The city is at the head of one of the most beautiful canyons in the world Waimea Canyon whose gorge is 900 meters 3000 feet deep
The island of Kauai was featured in Disneys 2002 animated feature film Lilo  Stitch
Knowledge means the things which are true as opposed to opinion
Information which is correct is knowledge
Knowledge can always be supported by evidence
If a statement is not supported by evidence then it is not knowledge
The evidence makes it justified it is not an opinion or a guess
Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject
This was the point of Ryles distinction between knowing that and knowing how
It can be implicit as with practical skill or expertise or explicit as with the theoretical understanding of a subject it can be more or less formal or systematic
In philosophy the study of knowledge is called epistemology
The philosopher Plato defined knowledge as justified true belief
This definition is the subject of the Gettier problems
All knowledge is a claim to be true but the claim can be incorrect
The only claims propositions which are certainly true are circular based on how we use words or terms
We can correctly claim that there are 360 degrees in a circle since that is part of how circles are defined
The point of Aristotles syllogism was to show that this kind of reasoning had a machinelike form 
If all swans are white and this is a swan then it must be white
But actually in the real world not all swans are white
The most widely accepted way to find reliable knowledge is the scientific method
Yet one thing all philosophers of science  agree is that there is that scientific knowledge is just the best we can do at any one time
All scientific knowledge is provisional not a claim of absolute truth
Knowledge in religion is different in that it depends on faith belief and the authority of religious leaders not on evidence of a scientific or legal kind
There are differing views on whether religious statements should be regarded as knowledge
In many expressions of Christianity such as Catholicism and Anglicanism knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit
In the Garden of Eden knowledge is the factor that made humans greedy and treacherous
But in the Book of Proverbs it states to be wise you must first obey the LORD 9

Kahoolawe is the smallest of the eight main volcanic islands of Hawaii
It is west of Maui and south of Lanai
It is roughly 11 miles long by  across 
The highest point Lua Makika is  above sea level
The island is dry because its low elevation does not cause much rain orographic precipitation to fall from the northeastern trade winds
Kahoolawe was used as a gunfire and bombing target by the United States military during World War II
It was a defense training area by the United States Navy from around 1941 until May 1994
Popular opinion in the state against this practice brought the end to this use
Navy has since been trying to cleanup unexploded ordnance bombs and explosive shells from the island
Ordnance is still buried or lying on the ground
Other items have washed down gullies and still other unexploded ordnance is underwater offshore
In 1981 the entire island was included on the National Register of Historic Places
The island is planned to be given back to the Hawaiian people
In 1993 the US Congress passed a law that recognized the cultural importance of the island required the Navy to return the island to the State and directed the Navy to do an unexploded ordnance UXO cleanup and environmental restoration 
The turnover officially occurred on November 11 2003 but the cleanup has not yet been completed
The US Navy was given 400 million and 10 years to complete the large cleanup task but this work has gone much slower than planned
In 1993 the Hawaii State Legislature established the Kahoolawe Island Reserve
It is made up of the whole island and waters out to  from shore
By State Law Kahoolawe and its waters can only be used for Native Hawaiian cultural spiritual and subsistence purposes fishing environmental restoration historic preservation and education
Commercial uses are not allowed
The Legislature also created the Kahoolawe Island Reserve Commission KIRC to manage the Reserve while it is held in trust for a future Native Hawaiian Sovereignty entity 
After the cleanup is finished the restoration of Kahoolawe will need ways to control erosion restore the plant life recharge the water table and slowly replace alien plants with native ones
Plans will include methods for damming gullies and reducing rainwater runoff
Nonnatives will temporarily stabilize some areas before the permanent planting of native plants
The kilometre is a common unit used for longer distances on Earth
The international unit for measuring distances is the metre and a kilometre is 1000 metres
It is used in some countries for measuring road and sea distances
In the UK and the USA the mile is used more than kilometres for road distances and the nautical mile for sea distances
It is often used to measure the speed of cars planes and boats by saying how many kilometres it can travel in an hour
This is shown as kmh
It is also spelled kilometer
This spelling is used in American English
One kilometre is 06214 miles 328084 feet
This means that one mile is 16093 kilometres
One kilometre is the approximate distance a healthy adult human being can walk in ten minutes

Language is the normal way humans communicate
Only humans use language though other animals communicate through other means
Human language has syntax a set of rules for connecting words together to make statements and questions
Language can also be changed by adding new words for example to describe new things
Other animals may inherit a set of calls which have preset functions
Language may be done by speech or by writing or by moving the hands to make signs
It follows that language is not just any way of communicating
Even some human communication is not language see nonverbal communication
Humans also use language for thinking
Language is a word that may be used by extension  The language of a community or country  The ability of speech  Formal language in mathematics logic and computing  Sign language for deaf people people who cannot hear  A type of school subject
UNESCO says that 2500 languages are at risk of becoming extinct
All languages share certain things which separate them from all other kinds of communication  A language has rules which are shared by a community  All human languages are based on sound and hearing or in the case of sign language vision
All the basic sound units or phonemes have this in common they can be spoken by the human voice and heard by the human ear  The sounds come out in a sequence not all at once
This is mimicked in writing where the marks are put on the paper or screen in the same sequence  The stream of sounds have little gaps between them and come in bigger packages
We call the bigger packets sentences or questions or replies or comments  In most languages English being one the syntax or order of the words can change the meaning the cat sat on the man is different from the man sat on the cat  Words which may be made up of more than one phoneme divide up into two classes content and noncontent
Content words have meaning nouns verbs adjectives etc
Noncontent words are there to make the language work and not in out what etc Grammar consists of studying how words fit together to mean something  All languages have  sentences with two types of expression nouns and verbs Jill is here  adjectives to modify nouns good food  ways of linking sink or swim  dummy elements Jill likes to swim so do I  devices to order or ask questions Get up
Are you ill  Most of the languages have a written form
Before the invention of audio recording the writing system was the only way to keep track of spoken information  All languages constantly evolve
New words appear new forms of saying things new accents
There are many more things in common between languages
The capacity to learn and use language is inherited
Normally all humans are born with this capability
Which language is learned by a child depends on which language is spoken by the childs community
The capacity is inherited but the particular language is learned
Children have a special period from about 18 months to about four years which is critical for learning the language
If this is seriously disrupted then their language skills will be damaged
Older people learn differently so they seldom learn a second language as well as they learn their native language
Mathematics and computer science use created languages called formal languages like computer programming languages but these may or may not be true languages
Mathematics itself is seen as a language by many
Some people consider musical notation to be a way of writing the musical language
Chinese is the language with the most native speakers in the world but Chinese is not really a language
It is a close family of dialects some of which are as different as Romance languages are from one another
English is often called the international language or lingua franca
It is the main second language of the world and the international language of science travel technology business diplomacy and entertainment
French had a similar status until the 20th century and other languages had it at other times 
English as a first language 380 million 
English as an official second language up to 300 million 
English taught as a second language but with no official status anyones guess up to 1000 million1 billion 
Chinese Mandarin 390 million native speakers
Some languages are made up so that a lot of people around the world can learn them without the new languages being tied to any specific country or place
These are called constructed languages
One of the most popular of these languages is Esperanto which is sometimes called La Internacia Lingvo or The International Language
 Another of these languages is called Volapuk which was popular about a hundred years ago but is much less popular now
It has mostly been replaced by languages like Esperanto Interlingua and Ido
Part of the reason that Volapuk became unpopular is that some sounds are hard to say for people who speak Spanish or English two of the most widely spoken languages in the world

baby is an example of life Life is a biological concept regarding the characteristics state or mode that separates a living thing from dead matter
The word itself may refer to a living being or ongoing processes of which living things are a part of
It may also refer to the period during which something is functional as between birth and death the condition of an entity that has been born but yet has to die or that which makes a living thing alive
The study of life is called biology and people who study life are called biologists
A lifespan is the average length of life in a species
All known life on Earth is powered by solar energy
Without energy from the sun no life could exist
All life on Earth is based on the chemistry of carbon compounds specifically involving longchain molecules such as proteins and nucleic acid
With water which is essential the long molecules are wrapped inside membranes to form cells
This may or may not be true of all possible forms of life in the Universe it is true of all life on Earth today
Living organisms are open systems
They are always changing because they exchange materials and information with their environment
They undergo metabolism maintain homeostasis possess a capacity to grow respond to stimuli and reproduce
Through natural selection they adapt to their environment in successive generations
More complex living organisms can communicate through various means
Many life forms can be found on Earth
The properties common to these organismsplants animals fungi protists archaea and bacteriaare a carbon and waterbased cellular form with complex organization and heritable genetic information
At present the Earth is the only planet we have detailed information about
The question of whether life exists elsewhere in the Universe is open
There have been a number of claims of life elsewhere in the Universe
None of these have been confirmed so far
The best evidence of life outside of Earth is are nucleic acids that have been found in certain types of meteorites
One explanation of life is called the cell theory
The cell theory has three basic points all living things are made up of cells
The cell is the smallest living thing that can do all the things needed for life
All cells must come from preexisting cells
Something is often said to be alive if it 
grows 
takes in food uses the food for energy and passes waste products see metabolism 
moves it must either move itself or have movement inside itself 
reproduces either sexually with another living thing or asexually by creating  of itself 
to its surroundings 
However not all living things fit every point on this list 
Mules cannot reproduce and neither can worker ants 
Viruses and spores are not actively alive metabolising until the conditions are right
They do however fit the biochemical definitions they are made of the same kind of chemicals
The thermodynamic definition of life is any system which can keep its entropy levels below maximum usually through adaptation and mutations
A modern definition was given by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela in 1980 to which they gave the name autopoiesis The production of their own components The correct assembly of these components Continuous repair and maintenance of their own existence
Roth commented that In short organisms are selfreproducing and selfmaintaining or autopoietic systems
This approach makes use of molecular biology ideas and systems science ideas

       signature  Zamenhof subskribosvg  Ludovic Lazarus Zamenhof December 15 1859 ndash April 14 1917 was an eye doctor linguist and scholar who created the international language Esperanto
Zamenhof was born in 1859 in the town of Biaystok Poland
At the time Poland was a part of the Russian Empire
Bialystok contained three major groups Poles Belorussians and Yiddishspeaking Jews
Zamenhof thought that one common language would join these groups and stop fights between them
His first language was said to be Polish
His parents spoke Russian and Yiddish in the home
His father was a German teacher so Zamenhof learned that language from an early age and spoke the language fluently
Later he learned French Latin Greek Hebrew and English
He also had an interest in Italian Spanish and Lithuanian
Zamenhof decided that the international language must have a simple grammar and be easier to learn than Volapk an earlier international language
He  to create the international language with a grammar that was  and 
The basics of Esperanto were published in 1887
His grandson LouisChristophe ZaleskiZamenhof has lived in France since the 1960s
He was 14 times nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize between 1907 and 1917

It is a group of many islands close to the east coast of Korea China and Russia
The Pacific Ocean is to the east of Japan and the Sea of Japan is to the west which means the origin of the Sun in Japanese
Japan is a monarchy whose head of state is called the Emperor
The Japanese changed Buddhism in many ways
For example Japanese Buddhists used ideas such as Zen more than other Buddhists
This new contact with Europeans and Americans changed the Japanese culture
The Meiji Restoration of 1868 stopped some old ways and added many new ones
The Empire of Japan was created and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it
It invaded and annexed Ryukyu Kingdom Taiwan and Korea
It had wars with China and Russia the First SinoJapanese War the Boxer Rebellion the RussoJapanese War and the Second SinoJapanese War which grew to become a part of World War II when Japan became allies with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy
In 1941 Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii a water base of the United States and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes
This started the United States involvement in World War II
American and Japanese forces fought each other in the Pacific
Once airbases were established within range of the Japanese mainland America began to win and started dropping bombs on Japanese cities
America was able to bomb most of the important cities and quickly brought Japan close to defeat
To make Japan surrender the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing 150000 Japanese citizens
Soon after this the Soviet Union began to fight against Japan and the Japanese army in Manchuria lost
Japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries accepting the Potsdam Proclamation
The United States occupied Japan and forced it to write a new constitution in which it promised to never go to war again
Japan is a group of islands in the Western Pacific off the coast of China
The four biggest islands are Honshu Hokkaido Shikoku and Kyushu and there are about 6000 smaller islands there
Japan is separated from the Asian continent by the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea
Honshu which means Mainland in the Japanese language is the biggest island
Hokkaido is the island north of Honshu
Kyushu is the island west of Honshu
Shikoku is the island to the southwest of Honshu

Okinawa   Since Japan is an island nation Japan has several problems over territory because maritime boundaries can be hard to protect
These days Japan is competing for at least 4 different territories
It cannot agree with some neighbouring countries on whether the land belongs to Japan or the other country
Senkaku Islands problem with China and Taiwan 
Liancourt Rocks island problem with South Korea 
Southern Chishima Islands problem with Russia 
Sea of Japan problem with South Korea and North Korea   Shinkansen or Bullet trains are a common form of transportation in Japan  There are several important international airports in Japan
Narita is the major international airport in the Tokyo area
Kansai International Airport serves as the main airport for Osaka Kobe and Kyoto
Chbu Centrair International Airport near Nagoya is the newest of the three
Haneda Airport is close to central Tokyo and is the largest domestic airport in the country
The Shinkansen is one of the fastest trains in the world and connects cities in Honshu and Kyushu
Networks of public and private railways are almost all over the country
People mostly travel between cities in buses
    Modern Japan is divided into 47 prefectures
Before the Meiji period 18681912 the nation was divided into provinces which were consolidated in the prefectural system
Lanai or Lnai is sixth largest of the Hawaiian Islands in the United States
It is also known as the Pineapple Island
The island is almost a circle in shape and is 18 miles wide in the longest direction
The land area is 140 sq
miles 367 km
It is separated from the island of Molokai by the Kalohi Channel to the north
Lanai was first seen by Europeans on 25 February 1779 by Captain Clerke with HMS Resolution on the James Cook Pacific Ocean trip
Clerke took command of the ship after Capt
Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on February 14 and was leaving the islands for the North Pacific
In 1922 Jim Dole the president of Dole Pineapple Company bought the island of Lanai
He made a large part of it into the worlds largest pineapple plantation
Tourism on Lanai started not long ago
That was when the growing of pineapple was slowly coming to an end in the Islands
On Lanai you can be with nature and feel the mood of the Hawaiian countryside
Not like nearby Oahu the only town Lanai City is small
It has no traffic or shopping centers
Tourists come mainly to relax
There are three hotels on Lanai and several golf courses
Canada a country and sovereign state in the northern part of North America is made up of thirteen administrative divisions ten provinces and three territories
The different levels of government in Canada are based on the principles of a federation those of each of the provinces and territories share power with the federal government
The territories governments have a more limited set of powers versus the federal government than that of the provinces
The provinces are in the south of Canada near the border with the United States
They go from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west
The territories are to the north where fewer people live close to the Arctic Circle and Arctic Ocean
Here is a list of the provinces and territories and their standard abbreviations with their capitals the cities where their governments are based and largest cities
Canadas national capital where the federal government meets is Ottawa
Law is a set of rules decided by a particular state meant for the purpose of keeping the peace and security of society
Courts or police may enforce this system of rules and punish people who break the laws such as by paying a fine or other penalty including jail
In ancient societies laws were written by leaders to set out rules on how people can live work and do business with each other
But many times in history when laws have been on a false basis to benefit few at the expense of society they have resulted in conflict
To prevent this in most countries today laws are written and voted on by groups of politicians in a legislature such as a parliament or congress elected chosen by the governed peoples
Countries today have a constitution for the overall framework of society and make further laws as needed for matters of detail
Members of society generally have enough freedom within all the legal things they can choose to do
An activity is illegal if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws
A legal code is a written code of laws that are enforced
This may deal with things like police courts or punishments
A lawyer jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law
In the United States there are two kinds of attorneys  transactional attorneys who write contracts and litigators who go to court
In the United Kingdom these professionals are called solicitors and barristers respectively
The Rule of Law is the law which says that government can only legally use its power in a way the government and the people agree on
It limits the powers a government has as agreed in a countrys constitution
The Rule of Law prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people
When leaders enforce the legal code honestly even on themselves and their friends this is an example of the rule of law being followed The rule of law wrote the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in 350 BC is better than the rule of any individual  Culture is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws and people also tend to trust the ideas based on family and social habits
In many countries throughout history religion and religious books like the Vedas Bible or the Koran have been a major source of law
Contract law sets rules on agreements to buy and sell items and services 
Medical law sets rules and guidelines for medical professionals it also states a patients own medical rights 
PhysicianPatient Privilege protects the patients private conversations with a medical physician doctor this also extends to their personal information like their contact details shared with medical personnel 
Property law states the rights and obligations that a person has when they buy sell or rent homes and land called real property or realty and objects called personal property 
Intellectual property  IP law involves the rights people have over things they create such as art music and literature
This is called copyright
It also protects inventions that people make by a kind of law called patent
It also covers the rights people have to the names of a company or a distinctive mark or logo
This is called trademark 
Trust law business Law sets out the rules for money that is put into an investment such as pension funds that people save up for their retirement
It involves many different types of law including administrative and property law 
Tort law helps people to make claims for compensation repayment when someone hurts them or hurts their property 
Criminal law is used by the government to prevent people from breaking laws and punish people who do break them 
Constitutional law deals with the important rights of the government and its relationship with the people
It mainly involves the interpretation of a constitution including things like the Separation of powers of the different branches of government 
A court order is an official proclamation by a judge that defines and authorizes the carrying out of certain steps for one or more parties to a case 
Administrative law is used by ordinary citizens who want to challenge decisions made by governments
It also involves things like regulations and the operation of the administrative agencies
International law is used to set out rules on how countries can act in areas such as trade the environment or military action
The Geneva Conventions on the conduct of war and the Roerich Pact are examples of international law 
Custom and tradition are practices that are widely adopted and agreed upon in a society thought often not in a written form
Custom and tradition can be enforced in courts and are sometimes considered as part of the legal reasoning in matters decided in courts
In some societies and cultures all law is or was custom and tradition though this is increasingly rare although there are some parts of the world where custom tradition are still binding or even the predominant form of law for example tribal lands or failed states
Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today
Civil law is based on legislation that is found in constitutions or statutes passed by government
The secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom
In civil law governments judges do not generally have much power and most of the laws and legal precedent are created by Members of Parliament
Common law is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases
It comes from England and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to the British Empire except Malta Scotland the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec
It is also the predominant form of law in the United States where many laws called statutes are written by Congress but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts
Common law had its beginnings in the Middle Ages when King John was forced by his barons to sign a document called the Magna Carta
Religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books
Examples include the Jewish Halakha Islamic Sharia and Christian Canon law
Until the 1700s Sharia law was the main legal system throughout the Muslim world
In some Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran the whole legal systems still base their law on Sharia law
Islamic law is often criticised because it often has harsh penalties for crimes
A serious criticism is the judgement of the European Court that sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy
The Turkish Refah Partys shariabased plurality of legal systems grounded on religion was ruled to contravene the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
The Court decided Refahs plan would do away with the States role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms and infringe the principle of nondiscrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy
The history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilizations
Ancient Egyptian law developed in 3000 BC
In 1760 BC King Hammurabi took ancient Babylonian law and organized it and had it chiseled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace
These laws became known as the Code of Hammurabi
The Torah from the Old Testament is an old body of law
It was written around 1280 BC
It has moral rules such as the Ten Commandments which tell people what things are not permitted
Sometimes people try to change the law
For example if prostitution is illegal they try to make it legal
In democracies the people in a country usually choose people called politicians to represent them in a legislature
Examples of legislatures include the Houses of Parliament in London the Congress in Washington DC the Bundestag in Berlin the Duma in Moscow and the Assemble nationale in Paris
Most legislatures have two chambers or houses a lower house and an upper house
To pass legislation a majority of Members of Parliament must vote for a bill in each house
The legislature is the branch of government that writes laws and votes on whether they will be approved
The judiciary is a group of judges who resolve peoples disputes and determine whether people who are charged with crimes are guilty
In some jurisdictions the judge does not find guilt or innocence but instead directs a jury how to interpret facts from a legal perspective but the jury determines the facts based on evidence presented to them and finds the guilt or innocences of the charged person
Most countries of common law and civil law systems have a system of appeals courts up to a supreme authority such as the Supreme Court or the High Court
The highest courts usually have the power to remove laws that are unconstitutional which go against the constitution
The executive is the governing center of political authority
In most democratic countries the executive is elected from people who are in the legislature
This group of elected people is called the cabinet
In France the US and Russia the executive branch has a President which exists separately from the legislature
The executive suggests new laws and deals with other countries
As well the executive usually controls the military the police and the bureaucracy
The executive selects ministers or secretaries of state to control departments such as the health department or the department of justice
In many jurisdictions the Head of State does not take part in the daytoday governance of the jurisdiction and takes a largely ceremonial role
This is the case in many Commonwealth nations where the Head of State usually a Governor almost exclusively acts on the advice of the head of the Executive eg
the Prime Minister First Minister or Premier
The primary legal role of the Head of State in these jurisdictions is to act as a check or balance against the Executive as the Head of State has the rarely exercised power to dissolve the legislature call elections and dismiss ministers
The police enforce the criminal laws by arresting people suspected of breaking the law
Bureaucrats are the government workers and government organizations that do work for the government
Bureaucrats work within a system of rules and they make their decisions in writing
Lawyers are people who have learned about laws
Lawyers give people advice about their legal rights and duties and represent people in court
To become a lawyer a person has to complete a two or threeyear university program at a law school and pass an entrance examination
Lawyers work in law firms for the government for companies or by themselves
Civil society is the people and groups that are not part of government that try to protect people against human rights abuses and try to protect freedom of speech and other individual rights
Organizations that are part of civil society include political parties debating clubs trade unions human rights organizations newspapers and charities
Corporations are among the organizations that use the legal system to further their goals
Like the others they use means such as campaign donations and advertising to persuade people that they are right
Corporations also engage in commerce and make new things such as automobiles vaporisersecigarettes and Unmanned aerial vehicles ie drones that the old laws are not well equipped to deal with
Corporations also makes use of a set of rules and regulations to ensure their employees remain loyal to them usually presented in a legal contract and that any disobedience towards these rules are considered uncivilized and therefore given grounds for immediate dismissal

Leather is the skin of an animal made into a durable material by tanning
The skins of cows pigs and goats are often used to make leather
Skins of snakes alligators or crocodiles and ostriches are sometimes used to make fancier leather
Shoes bags clothes and balls are often made of leather
Sometimes people make leather out of whales ducks giraffes and African elephants but all of these ways of making leather are very simple but can also be very hard and rare sometimes
A license or licence allows someone to do something that they otherwise are not allowed to do
A person usually has to pay some money and maybe pass a test to get a license
A license is usually written but it does not have to be
Most kinds of licenses can only be used by the person they were given to
Licenses may be temporary or permanent
Some licenses can not be taken away once they are given
A person with a license is called a licensee
For example John has a license to sell vegetables in the market for 10 years from 2010 to 2020
John grants an exclusive license to Jane to sell vegetables for 4 years from 2012 to 2016
Here John will be referred as licensor and Jane will be referred as licensee
In many countries if a person tries to do something without the correct license to do it he might have to pay a fine or go to prison
There are many different types of licenses
The laws of most countries say that people are only allowed to drive cars if they have a drivers license
If a person does not have a license they may have to pay a fine if they are caught by the police
In many countries a person must take a test and pay money to get a license
The test would check that they know the road rules and have the skill to drive a car
Other licenses give permission to shoot animals often called a hunting license
The hunting license usually says when a person may hunt
A hunter may have to pass a test to show that he understands the rules about hunting
In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland if someones has a television set they must buy a television licence every year
Copyright is a law that gives the owner of a creative work the right to decide what other people can do with it
A person or a company can give a license to a copyright that they own
So in order for another person to use an owners copyright they need permission from the owner
For example when someone buys computer software they also need a license from the creator of the software a copyright owner allowing the buyer to use the software
License is a verb and licence is a noun Licensing sessions were the meetings of magistrates which decided about giving licences to sell alcohol
In American English there is no difference in spelling between the verb to license  meaning to give permission and the noun a license meaning the permission to do something
A degree in medicine is a qualification showing a person has successfully studied medicine
It is awarded for life
A licence to practice medicine is a legal permission to do so within the territory covered by the licensing authority
The licence may be taken away under certain situations

The World Wide Web on the Internet is made of many different Web pages
The computer software that people use to make these pages HTML lets us go to other pages in a very fast and easy way
The person who makes the web page can tell the computer to show a word or a picture on the Web page as a link
This means that when we click on the link with our computer mouse the computer will show us the new page we want to see
Most links are blue but they can be any color
The color of the link will change to dark blue when clicked as the web browser recognises it in the browsers cache
Unless the cache is cleared the link will always stay dark blue
There are many ways in making a link on a web page
The process is different for different internet software
In  and  files a link can be created using this code     WikiSyntax like MediaWiki uses a simpler way of making links

Graz readingroo  A library is a place where many books are kept
Most libraries are public and let people take the books to use in their home
Most libraries let people borrow books for several weeks
Some belong to institutions for example companies churches schools and universities
Also a persons bookshelves at home can have many books and be a library
The people who work in libraries are librarians
Librarians are people who take care of the library
Other libraries keep famous or rare books
There are a few Copyright libraries which have a copy of every book which has been written in that country
Some libraries also have other things that people might like such as magazines music on CDs or computers where people can use the Internet
In school they offer software to learn the alphabet and other details
BudapestWith the spread of literacy libraries have become essential tools for learning
Libraries are very important for the progress and development of a societyLibraries are collections of books and other informational materials
People come to libraries for reading study or reference
Libraries contain a variety of materials
They contain printed materials films sound and video recordings maps photographs computer software online databases and other media
A library is not a bookstore a store that sells books
The prime purpose of a library is to provide access to knowledge and information
To fulfil this mission libraries preserve a valuable record of culture
Then they pass down this to the coming generations
Therefore they are an essential link between the past present and future
People utilise library resources in their work
They also use library resources to gain information about personal interests
Sometimes they obtain recreational materials such as films and novels
Students use libraries to enhance their classroom experiences
Libraries help the students to develop good reading and study habits
Public officials use libraries for research and public issues
The libraries provide information and services that are essential for learning and progress
This habit of reading can be developed only if we get into the habit of going to a library regularly and spending a lot of time there
That is the place that provides just the right atmosphere necessary for studies and assimilating and retaining all the knowledge taken it
The environment in a library is ideal for the intellectual growth of individuals
This is the place where one can get unlimited stocks of books on any and every subject that may be of interest or need for an individual
A library is the place where one can spend hours of time fruitfully and filled with interest
One can learn so much by reading books authored by eminent writers and thus become knowledgeable
Seacroft area of Leeds Many places have a public library where anybody can join if they live in the area
With a library card people can borrow books and take them home for several weeks
It does not cost money to get a library card at most public libraries
Books are kept on shelves in a special order so they are easy to find
Public libraries have stories and books about lots of things
Many public libraries have books and CDs about learning English
Stories are kept in alphabetical order by the last name of the person who wrote them the author
Books about other things are often given a special number that refers to what they are about
They are then put on the shelf in number order
One number system used by many libraries is the Dewey decimal system
Many colleges and universities have large academic libraries
These libraries are for the use of college students professors and researchers
Academic libraries are used mainly for doing research like studying the solar system or how earthquakes happen
These libraries do not have the same types of books you would find in a public library
They usually do not have fiction books or books for children unless they are being studied
Academic libraries can have many books sometimes more than a million
Special libraries are those libraries that are not public libraries or academic libraries
They are usually small
Many times a special library holds books on a particular subject or even a special kind of book
Some special libraries keep just old books or books by Shakespeare
A special library can be owned by a business for use only by that business
For example Disney World in Orlando has its own library that is not open to the public but for the use of the people who work for the company
A librarian is a person who works in a library
Librarians help people find books and information
They can teach people how to find books and use the library
A professional librarian is a person who went to school to study library science

The earliest known library was discovered in Iraq and belonged to the ancient civilization in Sumer
They didnt use paper books but instead wrote everything on clay tablets using a style of writing called cuneiform
These tablets are over 5000 years old
The Library of Alexandria in Egypt was the largest and most important library of the ancient world
It was destroyed when the Romans conquered Egypt in 30 BC
Romes first public library was established by Asinius Pollio who was a lieutenant of Julius Caesar
Eventually Rome would build 28 public libraries within the city
When the Roman Empire fell in 330 AD many books went east to the city of Byzantium where a large library was built
Other libraries were built in monasteries and public homes
Libraries began to appear in many Islamic cities where science and philosophy survived after the fall of the Roman Empire
Surprisingly Christian monks and Islamic libraries exchanged books to copy
These books eventually made there way

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics
It came from mathematicians trying to solve systems of linear equations
Vectors and matrices are used to solve these systems
The main objects of study currently are vector spaces and linear mappings between vector spaces
Linear algebra is useful in other branches of mathematics eg
differential equations and analytic geometry
It can also be applied to the real world in areas such as engineering physics and economics
Linear algebra describes ways to  and manipulate rearrange systems of linear equations
For example consider the following equations    These two equations form a system of linear equations
It is linear because none of the variables are raised to a power
The graph of a linear equation in two variables is a straight line
The solution to this system is    This is because it makes all of the original equations valid that is the value on the left side of the equals sign is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations
Linear algebra uses a system of notation for describing system behavior called a matrix
For the previous example the coefficients of the equations can be stored in a coefficient matrix
Legislature is a word that comes from the Latin language meaning those who write the laws
 A legislature is therefore a group of people who vote for new laws for example in a state or country
Each person in the legislature is usually either elected or appointed
The constitution of that state or country usually tells how a legislature is supposed to work
In many countries the legislature is called a Parliament Congress or National Assembly
Sometimes there are two groups of members in the legislature
This is called a bicameral legislature
A unicameral legislature has only one group of members
A country district city or other small area may also have something like a legislature
These are often called councils and they make smaller laws for their areas

Later a king called Chandragupt Maurya built an empire called the Maurya Empire in 300 BC
It made most of South Asia into one whole country
From 180 BC many other countries invaded India
Even later 100 BC  AD 1100 other Indian dynasties empires came including the Chalukyas Cholas Pallavas and Pandyas

The Cholas of Thanjavur were pioneers at war in the seas and invaded Malaya Borneo Cambodia
The influence of Cholas are still well noticeable in SE Asia
Many dynasties ruled India around the year 1000
Some of these were the Mughal Vijayanagara and the Maratha empires

Since 1991 India has been one of the fastestgrowing economies in the world
India is the largest democracy in the world
Indias government is divided into three parts the Legislative the one that makes the laws the Parliament the Executive the government and the Judiciary the one that makes sure that the laws are obeyed the supreme court
The legislative branch is made up of the Parliament of India which is in New Delhi the capital of India
The Parliament of India is divided into two houses  the upper house Rajya Sabha Council of States and the lower house Lok Sabha House of People
The Rajya Sabha has 250 members and the Lok Sabha has 552 members
In the South the climate is mainly tropical which means it can get very hot in summer and cool in winter
Currently the Indian Army is becoming more modern by buying and making new weapons
It is also building defences against missiles of other countries
In 2011 India imported more weapons than any other nation in the world
From its independence in 1947 India fought four wars with Pakistan and one war with China
For administration purposes India has been divided into smaller pieces
Most of these pieces are called states some are called union territories
States and union territories are different in the way they are represented
Most union territories are ruled by administrators sent by the central government
All the states and the territories of Delhi and Puducherry elect their local government themselves
In total there are twentynine states and seven union territories
There are  about certain parts of the Indian borders
Countries do not agree on where the borders are
Pakistan and China do not recognise the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir
The Indian government claims it as an Indian state
In July 1914 China withdrew from the agreement

symbol for litre is L or l
For smaller volumes the decilitre is used 10 dl  one litre
For smaller volumes the centilitre is used 100 cl  one litre
For smaller volumes the millilitre is used 1000 ml  one litre
The capital letter L is preferred by some people as the small l can look like the number one 1

1 litre  1 dm   The metric system was first introduced in France in 1791
That system did not have its own unit of capacity or volume because volume can be measured in cubic metres
The cadil was also known as the pinte or the litron
The pinte had been an old French unit of measure of capacity
In 1795 the definition was revised
The cadil was given the name litre
In 1795 the kilogram was defined to be exactly one litre of water at 4C
In 1799 the kilogram was redefined
The new definition said that the kilogram was the mass of the kilogram des archives
In 1901 scientists measured the volume of one litre of water at 4C very carefully
They found that it occupied about dm
The BIPM redefined the litre as being exactly the volume of one kilogram of water at 4C
In 1960 the SI was introduced
The BIPM changed the definition of the litre back to one dm
The litre is not part of SI
The BIPM defined the litre as a NonSI unit accepted for use with the SI
This was because it is used in many  countries
The BIPM said that the litre should not be used very very accurate work
According to SI rules the symbol for the litre should be l
This is because the litre was not named after somebody whose name was Litre
However the symbol l and the number 1 are easily confused
In 1979 the BIPM made an exception for the symbol for the litre
They said that people could use either L or l as its symbol
Mathematics is the study of numbers shapes and patterns
The word comes from the Greek word  mthema meaning science knowledge or learning and is sometimes shortened to maths in England Australia Ireland and New Zealand or math in the United States and Canada
The short words are often used for arithmetic geometry or simple algebra by students and their schools
Mathematics includes the study of  
Numbers how things can be counted 
Structure how things are organized
This subfield is usually called algebra 
Place where things are and their arrangement
This subfield is usually called geometry 
Change how things become different
This subfield is usually called analysis
Mathematics is useful for solving problems that occur in the real world so many people besides mathematicians study and use mathematics
Today some mathematics is needed in many jobs
People working in business science engineering and construction need some knowledge of mathematics
Mathematics solves problems by using logic
One of the main tools of logic used by mathematicians is deduction
Deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths
To a mathematician the reason something is true called a proof is just as important as the fact that it is true and this reason is often found using deduction
Using deduction is what makes mathematics thinking different from other kinds of scientific thinking which might rely on experiments or on interviews
Logic and reasoning are used by mathematicians to create general rules which are an important part of mathematics
These rules leave out information that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations
By finding general rules mathematics solves many problems at the same time as these rules can be used on other problems
These rules can be called theorems if they have been proved or conjectures if it is not known if they are true yet
Most mathematicians use nonlogical and creative reasoning in order to find a logical proof
Sometimes mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas that we dont understand yet
Often in mathematics ideas and rules are chosen because they are considered simple or neat
On the other hand sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics this has happened many times in the past
In general studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us understand the world better
Mathematics includes the study of numbers and quantities
Most of the areas listed below are studied in many different fields of mathematics including set theory and mathematical logic
The study of number theory usually focuses more on the structure and behavior of the integers rather than on the actual foundations of numbers themselves and so is not listed in this subsection

A leap year is a year in which an extra day is added to the Gregorian calendar which is used by most of the world
While an ordinary year has 365 days a leap year has 366 days
The extra day February 29 is added to the month of February
In an ordinary year February has 28 days but in a leap year it has 29 days
The extra day called a leap day is the same day of the week as the first day of the month February 1
Also in a leap year the months of January April and July all start on the same day of the week
A leap year comes once every four years
Because of this a leap year can always be evenly divided by four
For example 2016 was a leap year
But a year is rather a common year if it can be evenly divided by 100 but not by 400
This is why 1600 2000 and 2400 are leap years but 1700 1800 and 1900 were rather common years
We have leap years because instead of 365 days the Earth really takes a few minutes less than 36514 days 36524219 to go completely around the Sun
Without leap years the seasons would start one day earlier on the calendar every four years
After 360 years spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere which usually begins on March 21 would begin on December 21 which is when winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere presently begins
A number of countries use a lunar calendar based on the Moon instead of the Sun like our solar calendar is
They have leap years when they add an extra lunar month
Different calendars add the extra month in different ways

The animation is made of over 40 photographs taken by the Cassini spacecraft between October 31 and November 9 2000 explosions where parts of the comet Shoemaker Levy9 hit the planet artist of the Voyager 1 spacecraft that flew past Jupiter in 1979   The atmosphere near the  of Jupiter is made of about 88 to 92 hydrogen 8 to 12 helium and 1 other gases
Based on spectroscopy Jupiter seems to be made of the same gases as Saturn
It is different from Neptune or Uranus
These two planets have much less hydrogen and helium gas
The very high temperatures and pressures in Jupiters core mean scientists cannot tell what materials would be there
This cannot be found out because it is not possible to create the same amount of pressure on Earth
Above the unknown inner core is an outer core
The outer core of Jupiter is thick liquid hydrogen
The pressure is high enough to make the hydrogen solid but then it melts because of the heat
Jupiter is twice as massive as all the other planets in the Solar System put together
Jupiter is 11 times the width of Earth and 318 times as massive
The volume of Jupiter is 1317 times the volume of Earth
In other words 1317 Earthsized objects could fit inside it
Jupiter has many bands of clouds going  across its surface
The light parts are zones and the darker are belts
The zones and belts often  with each other
This causes huge storms
Wind speeds of 360kilometres per hour kmh are common on Jupiter
To show the difference the strongest tropical storms on Earth are about 100kmh
Most of the clouds on Jupiter are made of ammonia
There may also be clouds of water vapour like clouds on Earth
Spacecrafts such as Voyager 1 have seen lightning on the surface of the planet
Scientists think it was water vapour because lightning needs water vapour
The brown and orange colours are caused when sunlight passes through or refracts with the many gases in the atmosphere
One of the biggest features in Jupiters atmosphere is the Great Red Spot
It is a huge storm which is bigger than the entire Earth
It is on record since at least 1831 and as early as 1665
Images by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown as many as two smaller red spots right next to the Great Red Spot
Storms can last for hours or as long as hundreds of years in the case of the Great Red Spot
Jupiter has a magnetic field like Earths but 11 times stronger
It also has a magnetosphere much bigger and stronger than Earths
The field traps radiation belts much stronger than Earths Van Allen radiation belts strong enough to endanger any spacecraft travelling past or to Jupiter
The magnetic field is probably caused by the large amounts of liquid metallic hydrogen in the core of Jupiter
The four largest moons of Jupiter and many of the smaller ones orbit or go around the planet within the magnetic field
This protects them from the solar wind
Jupiters magnetic field is so large it reaches the orbit of Saturn 77 million miles 12 million km away
The Earths magnetosphere does not even cover its moon less than a quarter of a million miles 400000km away

It has 31 days
March is named after Mars the Roman god of war
March always begins on the same day of the week as November and additionally February in common years
March always ends on the same day of the week as June
daffodil is a symbol of the month of March when spring begins in the Northern Hemisphere In ancient Rome March was called Martius
It was named after the war god Mars and the Romans thought that it was a lucky time to begin a war
Before Julius Caesars calendar reform March was the first month of the year in the Roman calendar as the winter was considered to be a monthless period
March is one of seven months to have 31 days
March begins on the same day of the week as February in common years and November every year
March ends on the same day of the week as June every year as each others last days are exactly 13 weeks 91 days apart
In common years March starts on the same day of the week as June of the previous year and in leap years September and December of the previous year
In common years March finishes on the same day of the week as September of the previous year and in leap years April and December of the previous year
In years immediately before common years March starts on the same day of the week as August of the following year and in years immediately before leap years May of the following year
In years immediately before common years March finishes on the same day of the week as August and November of the following year and in years immediately before leap years May of the following year
In leap years the day before March 1 is February 29
This determines the position of each day of the year from there on
As an example March 1 is usually the 60th day of the year but in a leap year is the 61st day
In terms of seasons March is one of two months to have an equinox the other is September its seasonal equivalent in both  hemispheres with daylight and darkness of roughly the same number of hours halfway between the December and June solstices
In the Northern Hemisphere spring starts in this month while it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere
The official start of either season is March 1 though the equinox can fall on March 20 or 21 occasionally on March 19
The northern spring equinox marks the start of the Iranian New Year and Bahai New Year
It is from the March 21 date that Easters date is calculated on the Sunday after the first full moon in spring meaning it can fall between March 22 and April 25 in Western Christianity

vase shows a music lesson about 510 BC Louis Armstrong a jazz musician Estonian Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm 200 Spanish gypsy flamenco guitaris   Music is a form of art an expression of emotions through harmonic frequencies
Music is also a form of entertainment that puts sounds together in a way that people like find interesting or dance to
Most music includes people singing with their voices or playing musical instruments such as the piano guitar drums or violin
The word music comes from the Greek word mousike which means art of the Muses
In Ancient Greece the Muses included the goddesses of music poetry art and dance
Someone who makes music is known as a musician
Music is sound that has been organized by using rhythm melody or harmony
If someone bangs saucepans while cooking it makes noise
If a person bangs saucepans or pots in a rhythmic way they are making a simple type of music
There are four things which music has most of the time 
Music often has pitch
This means high and low notes
Tunes are made of notes that go up or down or stay on the same pitch 
Music often has rhythm
Rhythm is the way the musical sounds and silences are put together in a sequence
Every tune has a rhythm that can be tapped
Music usually has a regular beat 
Music often has dynamics
This means whether it is quiet or loud or somewhere in between 
Music often has timbre
This is a French word pronounced the French way TAMbr
The timbre of a sound is the way that a sound is interesting
The sort of sound might be harsh gentle dry warm or something else
Timbre is what makes a clarinet sound different from an oboe and what makes one persons voice sound different from another person
There is no simple definition of music which covers all cases
It is an art form and opinions come into play
Music is whatever people think is music
A different approach is to list the qualities music must have such as sound which has rhythm melody pitch timbre etc  These and other attempts do not capture all aspects of music or leave out examples which definitely are music
According to Thomas Clifton music is a certain reciprocal relation established between a person his behavior and a sounding object
Musical experience and the music together are called phenomena and the activity of describing phenomena is called phenomenology
Amun Tomb of  Nakht 18th Dynasty Western Thebes  Even in the stone age people made music
The first music was probably made trying to imitate sounds and rhythms that occurred naturally
Human music may echo these phenomena using patterns repetition and tonality
This kind of music is still here today
Shamans sometimes imitate sounds that are heard in nature
It may also serve as entertainment games or have practical uses like attracting animals when hunting indicating that the Neanderthals had language because the hyoid supports the voice box in the human throat
Most likely the first rhythm instruments or percussion instruments involved the clapping of hands stones hit together or other things that are useful to keep a beat
There are finds of this type that date back to the paleolithic
Some of these are ambiguous as they can be used either as a tool or a musical instrument
The oldest flute ever discovered may be the socalled  Divje Babe flute found in the Slovenian cave Divje Babe I in 1995
It is not certain that the object is really a flute
The item in question is a fragment of the femur of a young cave bear and has been dated to about 43000 years ago
However whether it is truly a musical instrument or simply a carnivorechewed bone is a matter of ongoing debate
The fiveholed flute has a Vshaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone
The researchers involved in the discovery officially published their findings in the journal Nature in June 2009
The discovery is also the oldest confirmed find of any musical instrument in history
Other flutes were also found in the cave
This  flute was found next to the Venus of Hohle Fels and a short distance from the oldest known human carving
When they announced their discovery the scientists suggested that the finds demonstrate the presence of a wellestablished musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe
The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near Greystones Ireland in 2004
A woodlined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood between 30 and 50cm long tapered at one end but without any finger holes
They may once have been strapped together
In 1986 several bone flutes were found in Jiahu in Henan Province China
They date to about 6000 BC
They have between 5 and 8 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird the Redcrowned Crane
At the time of the discovery one was found to be still playable
The bone flute plays both the five or sevennote scale of Xia Zhi and sixnote scale of Qing Shang of the ancient Chinese musical system
It is not known what the earliest music of the cave people was like
Some architecture even some paintings are thousands of years old but old music could not survive until people learned to write it down
The only way we can guess about early music is by looking at very old paintings that show people playing musical instruments or by finding them in archaeological digs digging underground to find old things
The earliest piece of music that was ever written down and that has not been lost was discovered on a tablet written in Hurrian a language spoken in and around northern Mesopotamia where Iraq is today from about 1500 BC
The Oxfords Companion to Music ed
Percy Scholes London 1970   Another early piece of written music that has survived was a round called Sumer Is Icumen In
It was written down by a monk around the year 1250
Much of the music in the Middle Ages roughly 4501420 was folk music played by working people who wanted to sing or dance
When people played instruments they were usually playing for dancers
However most of the music that was written down was for the Catholic church
This music was written for monks to sing in church
It is called Chant or Gregorian chant
In the Renaissance roughly 14001550 there was a lot of music and many composers wrote music that has survived so that it can be performed played or sung today
The name for this period Renaissance is a French word which means rebirth
This period was called the rebirth because many new types of art and music were reborn during this time
Some very beautiful music was written for use in church services sacred music by the Italian composer Giovanni da Palestrina 15251594
In Palestrinas music many singers sing together this is called a choir
There was also plenty of music not written for the church such as happy dance music and romantic love songs
Popular instruments during the Renaissance included the viols a string instrument played with a bow lutes a plucked stringed instrument that is a little like a guitar and the virginal a small quiet keyboard instrument
In the arts the Baroque was a Western cultural era which began near the turn of the 17th century in Rome
It was exemplified by drama and grandeur in sculpture painting literature dance and music
In music the term Baroque applies to the final period of dominance of imitative counterpoint where different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches sometimes inverting the echo and even reversing thematic material
The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement
The upper class also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control
Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence
In similar profusions of detail art music architecture and literature inspired each other in the Baroque cultural movement as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns
Some traits and aspects of Baroque paintings that differentiate this style from others are the abundant amount of details often bright polychromy less realistic faces of subjects and an overall sense of awe which was one of the goals in Baroque art
The word baroque probably derives from the ancient Portuguese noun barroco which is a pearl that is not round but of unpredictable and elaborate shape
Hence in informal usage the word baroque can simply mean that something is elaborate with many details without reference to the Baroque styles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
In western music the classical period means music from about 1750 to 1825
It was the time of composers like Joseph Haydn Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven
Orchestras became bigger and composers often wrote longer pieces of music called symphonies that had several sections called movements
Some movements of a symphony were loud and fast other movements were quiet and sad
The form of a piece of music was very important at this time
Music had to have a nice shape
They often used a structure which was called sonata form
Another important type of music was the string quartet which is a piece of music written for two violins a viola and a violoncello
Like symphonies string quartet music had several sections
Haydn Mozart and Beethoven each wrote many famous string quartets
The piano was invented during this time
Composers liked the piano because it could be used to play dynamics getting louder or getting softer
Other popular instruments included the violin the violoncello the flute the clarinet and the oboe
The 19th century is called the Romantic period
Composers were particularly interested in conveying their emotions through music
An important instrument from the Romantic period was the piano
Some composers such as Frederic Chopin wrote subdued expressive quietly emotional piano pieces
Often music described a feeling or told a story using sounds
Other composers such as Franz Schubert wrote songs for a singer and a piano player called Lied the German word for song
These Lieder plural of Lied told stories by using the lyrics words of the song and by the imaginative piano accompaniments
Other composers like Richard Strauss and Franz Liszt created narratives and told stories using only music which is called a tone poem
Composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms used the piano to play loud dramatic strongly emotional music
Many composers began writing music for bigger orchestras with as many as 100 instruments
It was the period of Nationalism the feeling of being proud of ones country when many composers made music using folksong or melodies from their country
Lots of famous composers lived at this time such as Franz Schubert Felix Mendelssohn Frederic Chopin Johannes Brahms Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Richard Wagner
From about 1900 onwards is called the modern period
Many 20th century composers wanted to compose music that sounded different from the Classical and Romantic music
Modern composers searched for new ideas such as using new instruments different forms different sounds or different harmonies
The composer Arnold Schoenberg 18741951 wrote pieces which were atonal meaning that they did not sound as if they were in any clear musical key
Later Schoenberg invented a new system for writing music called twelvetone system
Music written with the twelvetone system sounds strange to some but is mathematical in nature often making sense only after careful study
Pure twelvetone music was popular among academics in the fifties and sixties but some composers such as Benjamin Britten use it today when it is necessary to get a certain feel
One of the most important 20thcentury composers Igor Stravinsky 18821971 wrote music with very complicated difficult chords groups of notes that are played together and rhythms
Some composers thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote Minimalist pieces which use very simple ideas
In the 1950s and 1960s composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen experimented with electronic music using electronic circuits amplifiers and loudspeakers
In the 1970s composers began using electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from rock and roll music such as the electric guitar
They used these new instruments to make new sounds
Composers writing in the 1990s and the 2000s such as John Adams born 1947 and James MacMillan born 1959 often use a mixture of all these ideas but they like to write tonal music with easy tunes as well
